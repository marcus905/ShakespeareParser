DUKE ORSINO's palace.|Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords; Musicians attending|If music be the food of love, play on; Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken, and so die. That strain again! it had a dying fall: O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound, That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more: 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before. O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou, That, notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soe'er, But falls into abatement and low price, Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical.|Will you go hunt, my lord?|What, Curio?|The hart.|Why, so I do, the noblest that I have: O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first, Methought she purged the air of pestilence! That instant was I turn'd into a hart; And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds, E'er since pursue me. How now! what news from her?|So please my lord, I might not be admitted; But from her handmaid do return this answer: The element itself, till seven years' heat, Shall not behold her face at ample view; But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk And water once a day her chamber round With eye-offending brine: all this to season A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembrance.|O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother, How will she love, when the rich golden shaft Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else That live in her; when liver, brain and heart, These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd Her sweet perfections with one self king! Away before me to sweet beds of flowers: Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.|SCENE II. The sea-coast.|Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors|What country, friends, is this?|This is Illyria, lady.|And what should I do in Illyria? My brother he is in Elysium. Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?|It is perchance that you yourself were saved.|O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.|True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance, Assure yourself, after our ship did split, When you and those poor number saved with you Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother, Most provident in peril, bind himself, Courage and hope both teaching him the practise, To a strong mast that lived upon the sea; Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see.|For saying so, there's gold: Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope, Whereto thy speech serves for authority, The like of him. Know'st thou this country?|Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born Not three hours' travel from this very place.|Who governs here?|A noble duke, in nature as in name.|What is the name?|Orsino.|Orsino! I have heard my father name him: He was a bachelor then.|And so is now, or was so very late; For but a month ago I went from hence, And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know, What great ones do the less will prattle of,-- That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.|What's she?|A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died: for whose dear love, They say, she hath abjured the company And sight of men.|O that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is!|That were hard to compass; Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the duke's.|There is a fair behavior in thee, captain; And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously, Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke: Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him: It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service. What else may hap to time I will commit; Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.|Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be: When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.|I thank thee: lead me on.|SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.|Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA|What a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.|By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o' nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.|Why, let her except, before excepted.|Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.|Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am: these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be these boots too: an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps.|That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.|Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?|Ay, he.|He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.|What's that to the purpose?|Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.|Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats: he's a very fool and a prodigal.|Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.|He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.|By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors that say so of him. Who are they?|They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.|With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.|Enter SIR ANDREW|Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!|Sweet Sir Andrew!|Bless you, fair shrew.|And you too, sir.|Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.|What's that?|My niece's chambermaid.|Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.|My name is Mary, sir.|Good Mistress Mary Accost,--|You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.|By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?|Fare you well, gentlemen.|An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.|An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?|Sir, I have not you by the hand.|Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.|Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.|Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?|It's dry, sir.|Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?|A dry jest, sir.|Are you full of them?|Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren.|Exit|O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I see thee so put down?|Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.|No question.|An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home to-morrow, Sir Toby.|Pourquoi, my dear knight?|What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but followed the arts!|Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.|Why, would that have mended my hair?|Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.|But it becomes me well enough, does't not?|Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs and spin it off.|Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.|She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't, man.|I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.|Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?|As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man.|What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?|Faith, I can cut a caper.|And I can cut the mutton to't.|And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.|Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.|Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?|What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?|Taurus! That's sides and heart.|No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!|SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.|Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire|If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.|You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love: is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?|No, believe me.|I thank you. Here comes the count.|Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants|Who saw Cesario, ho?|On your attendance, my lord; here.|Stand you a while aloof, Cesario, Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd To thee the book even of my secret soul: Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her; Be not denied access, stand at her doors, And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow Till thou have audience.|Sure, my noble lord, If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow As it is spoke, she never will admit me.|Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds Rather than make unprofited return.|Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?|O, then unfold the passion of my love, Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith: It shall become thee well to act my woes; She will attend it better in thy youth Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.|I think not so, my lord.|Dear lad, believe it; For they shall yet belie thy happy years, That say thou art a man: Diana's lip Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound, And all is semblative a woman's part. I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair. Some four or five attend him; All, if you will; for I myself am best When least in company. Prosper well in this, And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord, To call his fortunes thine.|I'll do my best To woo your lady: yet, a barful strife! Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.|SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.|Enter MARIA and Clown|Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.|Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours.|Make that good.|He shall see none to fear.|A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'|Where, good Mistress Mary?|In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.|Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use their talents.|Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or, to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?|Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and, for turning away, let summer bear it out.|You are resolute, then?|Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.|That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both break, your gaskins fall.|Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.|Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.|Re-enter MARIA|Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.|From the Count Orsino, is it?|I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.|Who of my people hold him in delay?|Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.|Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but madman: fie on him! Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it. Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and people dislike it.|Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a most weak pia mater.|Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face. We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.|Enter SIR TOBY BELCH|By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?|A gentleman.|A gentleman! what gentleman?|'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these pickle-herring! How now, sot!|Good Sir Toby!|Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?|Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.|Ay, marry, what is he?|Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.|Re-enter MALVOLIO|Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him, lady? he's fortified against any denial.|Tell him he shall not speak with me.|Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he'll speak with you.|What kind o' man is he?|Why, of mankind.|What manner of man?|Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.|Of what personage and years is he?|Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.|Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.|Gentlewoman, my lady calls.|Here, madam, at your service.|Run after that same peevish messenger, The county's man: he left this ring behind him, Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it. Desire him not to flatter with his lord, Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him: If that the youth will come this way to-morrow, I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.|Madam, I will.|Enter VIOLA, and Attendants|The honourable lady of the house, which is she?|Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will?|Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away my speech, for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.|Whence came you, sir?|I can say little more than I have studied, and that question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech.|Are you a comedian?|No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house?|If I do not usurp myself, I am.|Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message.|Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.|Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.|It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you, keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates, and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.|Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.|No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.|Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.|It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.|Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?|The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears, divinity, to any other's, profanation.|Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity. Now, sir, what is your text?|Most sweet lady,--|A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it. Where lies your text?|In Orsino's bosom.|In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?|To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.|O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?|Good madam, let me see your face.|Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture. Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't not well done?|Unveiling|Excellently done, if God did all.|'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.|'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on: Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive, If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copy.|O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be inventoried, and every particle and utensil labelled to my will: as, item, two lips, indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me?|I see you what you are, you are too proud; But, if you were the devil, you are fair. My lord and master loves you: O, such love Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd The nonpareil of beauty!|How does he love me?|With adorations, fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.|Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him: Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth; In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant; And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him; He might have took his answer long ago.|If I did love you in my master's flame, With such a suffering, such a deadly life, In your denial I would find no sense; I would not understand it.|Why, what would you?|Make me a willow cabin at your gate, And call upon my soul within the house; Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night; Halloo your name to the reverberate hills And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest Between the elements of air and earth, But you should pity me!|You might do much. What is your parentage?|Above my fortunes, yet my state is well: I am a gentleman.|Get you to your lord; I cannot love him: let him send no more; Unless, perchance, you come to me again, To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well: I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.|I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse: My master, not myself, lacks recompense. Love make his heart of flint that you shall love; And let your fervor, like my master's, be Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.|II|SCENE I. The sea-coast.|Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN|Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?|By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.|Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.|No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo. My father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that; for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned.|Alas the day!|A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but, though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.|Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.|O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.|If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.|If you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.|SCENE II. A street.|Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following|Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?|Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.|She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him: and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.|She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.|Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.|SCENE III. OLIVIA's house.|Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW|Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo surgere,' thou know'st,--|Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up late is to be up late.|A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the four elements?|Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking.|Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink. Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!|Enter Clown|Here comes the fool, i' faith.|How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture of 'we three'?|Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.|By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman: hadst it?|I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.|Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a song.|Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.|There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--|Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?|A love-song, a love-song.|Ay, ay: I care not for good life.|O mistress mine, where are you roaming? O, stay and hear; your true love's coming, That can sing both high and low: Trip no further, pretty sweeting; Journeys end in lovers meeting, Every wise man's son doth know.|Excellent good, i' faith.|Good, good.|What is love? 'tis not hereafter; Present mirth hath present laughter; What's to come is still unsure: In delay there lies no plenty; Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty, Youth's a stuff will not endure.|A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.|A contagious breath.|Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.|To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?|An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.|By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.|Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'|'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.|'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'|I shall never begin if I hold my peace.|Good, i' faith. Come, begin.|Enter MARIA|What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.|My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not I consanguineous? am I not of her blood? Tillyvally. Lady! 'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'|Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.|Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it more natural.|'O, the twelfth day of December,'--|For the love o' God, peace!|Enter MALVOLIO|My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?|We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!|Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you, that, though she harbours you as her kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell.|'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'|Nay, good Sir Toby.|'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'|Is't even so?|'But I will never die.'|Sir Toby, there you lie.|This is much credit to you.|'Shall I bid him go?'|'What an if you do?'|'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'|'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'|Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a steward? Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?|Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.|Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!|Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any thing more than contempt, you would not give means for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.|SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.|Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others|Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends. Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we heard last night: Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times: Come, but one verse.|He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.|Who was it?|Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.|Seek him out, and play the tune the while. Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me; For such as I am all true lovers are, Unstaid and skittish in all motions else, Save in the constant image of the creature That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?|It gives a very echo to the seat Where Love is throned.|Thou dost speak masterly: My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves: Hath it not, boy?|A little, by your favour.|What kind of woman is't?|Of your complexion.|She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?|About your years, my lord.|Too old by heaven: let still the woman take An elder than herself: so wears she to him, So sways she level in her husband's heart: For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than women's are.|I think it well, my lord.|Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent; For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.|And so they are: alas, that they are so; To die, even when they to perfection grow!|Re-enter CURIO and Clown|O, fellow, come, the song we had last night. Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain; The spinsters and the knitters in the sun And the free maids that weave their thread with bones Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth, And dallies with the innocence of love, Like the old age.|Are you ready, sir?|Ay; prithee, sing.|Come away, come away, death, And in sad cypress let me be laid; Fly away, fly away breath; I am slain by a fair cruel maid. My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, O, prepare it! My part of death, no one so true Did share it. Not a flower, not a flower sweet On my black coffin let there be strown; Not a friend, not a friend greet My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown: A thousand thousand sighs to save, Lay me, O, where Sad true lover never find my grave, To weep there!|There's for thy pains.|No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.|I'll pay thy pleasure then.|Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.|Give me now leave to leave thee.|Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be every thing and their intent every where; for that's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.|SCENE V. OLIVIA's garden.|Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN|Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.|Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy.|Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?|I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o' favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.|To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?|An we do not, it is pity of our lives.|Here comes the little villain. How now, my metal of India!|Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there, for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.|Taking up the letter|Now is the woodcock near the gin.|O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading aloud to him!|By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.|Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?|'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax. Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?|This wins him, liver and all.|Jove knows I love: But who? Lips, do not move; No man must know. 'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be thee, Malvolio?|Marry, hang thee, brock!|I may command where I adore; But silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore: M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.|A fustian riddle!|Excellent wench, say I.|'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let me see, let me see, let me see.|What dish o' poison has she dressed him!|And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!|'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity; there is no obstruction in this: and the end,--what should that alphabetical position portend? If I could make that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A, I,--|O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.|Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as rank as a fox.|M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.|Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is excellent at faults.|M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.|And O shall end, I hope.|Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!|And then I comes behind.|Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you.|M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my name. Soft! here follows prose. 'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them; and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell. She that would alter services with thee, THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.' Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man. I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript. 'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.' Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do everything that thou wilt have me.|III|SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.|Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour|Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by thy tabour?|No, sir, I live by the church.|Art thou a churchman?|No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.|So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.|You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!|Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton.|I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.|Why, man?|Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.|Thy reason, man?|Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.|I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.|Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.|Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?|No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words.|I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.|Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun, it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.|Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee. Hold, there's expenses for thee.|Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!|By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for one; though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?|Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?|Yes, being kept together and put to use.|I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus.|I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.|The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will construe to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.|Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW|Save you, gentleman.|And you, sir.|Dieu vous garde, monsieur.|Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.|I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.|Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her.|I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the list of my voyage.|Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.|My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.|I mean, to go, sir, to enter.|I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we are prevented. Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you!|That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.|My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear.|'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em all three all ready.|Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing. Give me your hand, sir.|My duty, madam, and most humble service.|What is your name?|Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.|My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment: You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.|And he is yours, and his must needs be yours: Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.|For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts, Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!|Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf.|O, by your leave, I pray you, I bade you never speak again of him: But, would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres.|Dear lady,--|Give me leave, beseech you. I did send, After the last enchantment you did here, A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you: Under your hard construction must I sit, To force that on you, in a shameful cunning, Which you knew none of yours: what might you think? Have you not set mine honour at the stake And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom, Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.|I pity you.|That's a degree to love.|No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof, That very oft we pity enemies.|Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again. O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud! If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf! The clock upbraids me with the waste of time. Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you: And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest, Your were is alike to reap a proper man: There lies your way, due west.|Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition Attend your ladyship! You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?|Stay: I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.|That you do think you are not what you are.|If I think so, I think the same of you.|Then think you right: I am not what I am.|I would you were as I would have you be!|Would it be better, madam, than I am? I wish it might, for now I am your fool.|O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful In the contempt and anger of his lip! A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon. Cesario, by the roses of the spring, By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing, I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride, Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide. Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause, But rather reason thus with reason fetter, Love sought is good, but given unsought better.|By innocence I swear, and by my youth I have one heart, one bosom and one truth, And that no woman has; nor never none Shall mistress be of it, save I alone. And so adieu, good madam: never more Will I my master's tears to you deplore.|Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.|SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.|Exit SIR ANDREW|This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.|I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand strong, or so.|We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll not deliver't?|Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of the anatomy.|And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.|SCENE III. A street.|Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO|I would not by my will have troubled you; But, since you make your pleasure of your pains, I will no further chide you.|I could not stay behind you: my desire, More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth; And not all love to see you, though so much As might have drawn one to a longer voyage, But jealousy what might befall your travel, Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger, Unguided and unfriended, often prove Rough and unhospitable: my willing love, The rather by these arguments of fear, Set forth in your pursuit.|My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks; and ever oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay: But, were my worth as is my conscience firm, You should find better dealing. What's to do? Shall we go see the reliques of this town?|To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.|I am not weary, and 'tis long to night: I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this city.|Would you'ld pardon me; I do not without danger walk these streets: Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys I did some service; of such note indeed, That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.|Belike you slew great number of his people.|The offence is not of such a bloody nature; Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answer'd in repaying What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake, Most of our city did: only myself stood out; For which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear.|Do not then walk too open.|It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse. In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet, Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.|Why I your purse?|Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase; and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir.|I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you For an hour.|To the Elephant.|I do remember.|SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.|Enter OLIVIA and MARIA|I have sent after him: he says he'll come; How shall I feast him? what bestow of him? For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd. I speak too loud. Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil, And suits well for a servant with my fortunes: Where is Malvolio?|He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He is, sure, possessed, madam.|Why, what's the matter? does he rave?|No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.|Go call him hither. I am as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be. How now, Malvolio!|Sweet lady, ho, ho.|Smilest thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.|Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and please all.'|Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?|Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.|Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?|To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.|God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft?|How do you, Malvolio?|At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.|Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?|'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.|What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?|'Some are born great,'--|Ha!|'Some achieve greatness,'--|What sayest thou?|'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'|Heaven restore thee!|'Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,'--|Thy yellow stockings!|'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'|Cross-gartered!|'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--|Am I made?|'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'|Why, this is very midsummer madness.|Enter Servant|Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he attends your ladyship's pleasure.|I'll come to him. Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry.|Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA|O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she; 'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity;' and consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked.|Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN|Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.|Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir? how is't with you, man?|Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go off.|Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.|Ah, ha! does she so?|Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how is't with you? What, man! defy the devil: consider, he's an enemy to mankind.|Do you know what you say?|La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!|Carry his water to the wise woman.|Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.|How now, mistress!|O Lord!|Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do you not see you move him? let me alone with him.|No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough, and will not be roughly used.|Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?|Sir!|Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang him, foul collier!|Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.|My prayers, minx!|No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.|Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow things: I am not of your element: you shall know more hereafter.|Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA|Here he comes with your niece: give them way till he take leave, and presently after him.|I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge.|Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA|I have said too much unto a heart of stone And laid mine honour too unchary out: There's something in me that reproves my fault; But such a headstrong potent fault it is, That it but mocks reproof.|With the same 'havior that your passion bears Goes on my master's grief.|Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture; Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you; And I beseech you come again to-morrow. What shall you ask of me that I'll deny, That honour saved may upon asking give?|Nothing but this; your true love for my master.|How with mine honour may I give him that Which I have given to you?|I will acquit you.|Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well: A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.|Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN|Gentleman, God save thee.|And you, sir.|That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end: dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.|You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man.|You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.|I pray you, sir, what is he?|He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and his incensement at this moment is so implacable, that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.|I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that quirk.|Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury: therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on, or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.|This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.|I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.|Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW|Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.|Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.|Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.|Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip, and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.|I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls. Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you. I have his horse to take up the quarrel: I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.|He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.|There's no remedy, sir; he will fight with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.|Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man.|Give ground, if you see him furious.|Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you; he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he will not hurt you. Come on; to't.|Pray God, he keep his oath!|I do assure you, 'tis against my will.|Enter ANTONIO|Put up your sword. If this young gentleman Have done offence, I take the fault on me: If you offend him, I for him defy you.|You, sir! why, what are you?|One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will.|Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.|Enter Officers|O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.|I'll be with you anon.|Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.|Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you, I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily and reins well.|This is the man; do thy office.|Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.|You do mistake me, sir.|No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head. Take him away: he knows I know him well.|I must obey. This comes with seeking you: But there's no remedy; I shall answer it. What will you do, now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed; But be of comfort.|Come, sir, away.|I must entreat of you some of that money.|What money, sir? For the fair kindness you have show'd me here, And, part, being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my lean and low ability I'll lend you something: my having is not much; I'll make division of my present with you: Hold, there's half my coffer.|Will you deny me now? Is't possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery, Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you.|I know of none; Nor know I you by voice or any feature: I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood.|O heavens themselves!|Come, sir, I pray you, go.|Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death, Relieved him with such sanctity of love, And to his image, which methought did promise Most venerable worth, did I devotion.|What's that to us? The time goes by: away!|But O how vile an idol proves this god Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame. In nature there's no blemish but the mind; None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind: Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.|The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.|Lead me on.|Exit with Officers|Methinks his words do from such passion fly, That he believes himself: so do not I. Prove true, imagination, O, prove true, That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!|Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.|He named Sebastian: I my brother know Yet living in my glass; even such and so In favour was my brother, and he went Still in this fashion, colour, ornament, For him I imitate: O, if it prove, Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.|IV|SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.|Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown|Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?|Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow: Let me be clear of thee.|Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.|I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou know'st not me.|Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?|I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give worse payment.|By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men that give fools money get themselves a good report--after fourteen years' purchase.|Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN|Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.|Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all the people mad?|Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.|This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be in some of your coats for two pence.|Enter OLIVIA|Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!|Madam!|Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch, Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves, Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight! Be not offended, dear Cesario. Rudesby, be gone! I prithee, gentle friend, Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway In this uncivil and thou unjust extent Against thy peace. Go with me to my house, And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go: Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me, He started one poor heart of mine in thee.|What relish is in this? how runs the stream? Or I am mad, or else this is a dream: Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep; If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!|Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!|Madam, I will.|O, say so, and so be!|SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.|Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA|'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin, Tell me how thy lady does.'|Fool!|'My lady is unkind, perdy.'|Fool!|'Alas, why is she so?'|Fool, I say!|'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?|Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper: as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to thee for't.|Master Malvolio?|Ay, good fool.|Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?|Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.|But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no better in your wits than a fool.|They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to face me out of my wits.|Advise you what you say; the minister is here. Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore! endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble babble.|Sir Topas!|Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I, sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas. Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.|Fool, fool, fool, I say!|Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am shent for speaking to you.|Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.|Well-a-day that you were, sir|By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and light; and convey what I will set down to my lady: it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing of letter did.|I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?|Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.|Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.|Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I prithee, be gone.|I am gone, sir, And anon, sir, I'll be with you again, In a trice, Like to the old Vice, Your need to sustain; Who, with dagger of lath, In his rage and his wrath, Cries, ah, ha! to the devil: Like a mad lad, Pare thy nails, dad; Adieu, good man devil.|SCENE III. OLIVIA's garden.|Enter SEBASTIAN|This is the air; that is the glorious sun; This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't; And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus, Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then? I could not find him at the Elephant: Yet there he was; and there I found this credit, That he did range the town to seek me out. His counsel now might do me golden service; For though my soul disputes well with my sense, That this may be some error, but no madness, Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune So far exceed all instance, all discourse, That I am ready to distrust mine eyes And wrangle with my reason that persuades me To any other trust but that I am mad Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so, She could not sway her house, command her followers, Take and give back affairs and their dispatch With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing As I perceive she does: there's something in't That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.|Enter OLIVIA and Priest|Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well, Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by: there, before him, And underneath that consecrated roof, Plight me the full assurance of your faith; That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace. He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note, What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth. What do you say?|I'll follow this good man, and go with you; And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.|Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine, That they may fairly note this act of mine!|V|SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.|Enter Clown and FABIAN|Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.|Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.|Any thing.|Do not desire to see this letter.|This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my dog again.|Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords|Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?|Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.|I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?|Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse for my friends.|Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.|No, sir, the worse.|How can that be?|Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me; now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends, I am abused: so that, conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for my friends and the better for my foes.|Why, this is excellent.|By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be one of my friends.|Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.|But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would you could make it another.|O, you give me ill counsel.|Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it.|Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a double-dealer: there's another.|Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex, sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.|You can fool no more money out of me at this throw: if you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further.|Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness: but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I will awake it anon.|Enter ANTONIO and Officers|That face of his I do remember well; Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war: A bawbling vessel was he captain of, For shallow draught and bulk unprizable; With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet, That very envy and the tongue of loss Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?|Orsino, this is that Antonio That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy; And this is he that did the Tiger board, When your young nephew Titus lost his leg: Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state, In private brabble did we apprehend him.|He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side; But in conclusion put strange speech upon me: I know not what 'twas but distraction.|Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief! What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies, Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear, Hast made thine enemies?|Orsino, noble sir, Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me: Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither: That most ingrateful boy there by your side, From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was: His life I gave him and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication; for his sake Did I expose myself, pure for his love, Into the danger of this adverse town; Drew to defend him when he was beset: Where being apprehended, his false cunning, Not meaning to partake with me in danger, Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance, And grew a twenty years removed thing While one would wink; denied me mine own purse, Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before.|How can this be?|When came he to this town?|To-day, my lord; and for three months before, No interim, not a minute's vacancy, Both day and night did we keep company.|Enter OLIVIA and Attendants|Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth. But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness: Three months this youth hath tended upon me; But more of that anon. Take him aside.|What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable? Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.|Madam!|Gracious Olivia,--|What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--|My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.|If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music.|Still so cruel?|Still so constant, lord.|What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?|Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.|Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this: Since you to non-regardance cast my faith, And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favour, Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still; But this your minion, whom I know you love, And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly, Him will I tear out of that cruel eye, Where he sits crowned in his master's spite. Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief: I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love, To spite a raven's heart within a dove.|And I, most jocund, apt and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.|Where goes Cesario?|After him I love More than I love these eyes, more than my life, More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife. If I do feign, you witnesses above Punish my life for tainting of my love!|Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!|Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?|Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long? Call forth the holy father.|Come, away!|Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.|Husband!|Ay, husband: can he that deny?|Her husband, sirrah!|No, my lord, not I.|Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety: Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up; Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st. O, welcome, father! Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence, Here to unfold, though lately we intended To keep in darkness what occasion now Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.|A contract of eternal bond of love, Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands, Attested by the holy close of lips, Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings; And all the ceremony of this compact Seal'd in my function, by my testimony: Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave I have travell'd but two hours.|O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow, That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow? Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.|My lord, I do protest--|O, do not swear! Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.|To FABIAN|'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it: though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right, or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury. THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'|Did he write this?|Ay, madam.|This savours not much of distraction.|See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither. My lord so please you, these things further thought on, To think me as well a sister as a wife, One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you, Here at my house and at my proper cost.|Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer. Your master quits you; and for your service done him, So much against the mettle of your sex, So far beneath your soft and tender breeding, And since you call'd me master for so long, Here is my hand: you shall from this time be Your master's mistress.|A sister! you are she.|Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO|Is this the madman?|Ay, my lord, this same. How now, Malvolio!|Madam, you have done me wrong, Notorious wrong.|Have I, Malvolio? no.|Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter. You must not now deny it is your hand: Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase; Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention: You can say none of this: well, grant it then And tell me, in the modesty of honour, Why you have given me such clear lights of favour, Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you, To put on yellow stockings and to frown Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people; And, acting this in an obedient hope, Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd, Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest, And made the most notorious geck and gull That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.|Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though, I confess, much like the character But out of question 'tis Maria's hand. And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling, And in such forms which here were presupposed Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content: This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee; But when we know the grounds and authors of it, Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause.|Good madam, hear me speak, And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour, Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not, Most freely I confess, myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here, Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceived against him: Maria writ The letter at Sir Toby's great importance; In recompense whereof he hath married her. How with a sportful malice it was follow'd, May rather pluck on laughter than revenge; If that the injuries be justly weigh'd That have on both sides pass'd.|Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!|Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.' But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:' and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.|I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.|Exeunt all, except Clown|When that I was and a little tiny boy, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, A foolish thing was but a toy, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came to man's estate, With hey, ho, &amp;c. 'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate, For the rain, &amp;c. But when I came, alas! to wive, With hey, ho, &amp;c. By swaggering could I never thrive, For the rain, &amp;c. But when I came unto my beds, With hey, ho, &amp;c. With toss-pots still had drunken heads, For the rain, &amp;c. A great while ago the world begun, With hey, ho, &amp;c. But that's all one, our play is done, And we'll strive to please you every day.|
