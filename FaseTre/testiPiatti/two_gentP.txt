Verona. An open place.|Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS|Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus: Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits. Were't not affection chains thy tender days To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love, I rather would entreat thy company To see the wonders of the world abroad, Than, living dully sluggardized at home, Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness. But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein, Even as I would when I to love begin.|Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu! Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel: Wish me partaker in thy happiness When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger, If ever danger do environ thee, Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers, For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.|And on a love-book pray for my success?|Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.|That's on some shallow story of deep love: How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.|That's a deep story of a deeper love: For he was more than over shoes in love.|'Tis true; for you are over boots in love, And yet you never swum the Hellespont.|Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.|No, I will not, for it boots thee not.|What?|To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans; Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights: If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain; If lost, why then a grievous labour won; However, but a folly bought with wit, Or else a wit by folly vanquished.|So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.|So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.|'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.|Love is your master, for he masters you: And he that is so yoked by a fool, Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.|Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud The eating canker dwells, so eating love Inhabits in the finest wits of all.|And writers say, as the most forward bud Is eaten by the canker ere it blow, Even so by love the young and tender wit Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud, Losing his verdure even in the prime And all the fair effects of future hopes. But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee, That art a votary to fond desire? Once more adieu! my father at the road Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.|And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.|Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave. To Milan let me hear from thee by letters Of thy success in love, and what news else Betideth here in absence of thy friend; And likewise will visit thee with mine.|All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!|As much to you at home! and so, farewell.|Exit|He after honour hunts, I after love: He leaves his friends to dignify them more, I leave myself, my friends and all, for love. Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me, Made me neglect my studies, lose my time, War with good counsel, set the world at nought; Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.|Enter SPEED|Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?|But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.|Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already, And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.|Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray, An if the shepherd be a while away.|You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then, and I a sheep?|I do.|Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.|A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.|This proves me still a sheep.|True; and thy master a shepherd.|Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.|It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.|The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks not me: therefore I am no sheep.|The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for wages followest thy master; thy master for wages follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.|Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'|But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?|Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a lost mutton, nothing for my labour.|Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.|If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.|Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.|Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter.|You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.|From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over, 'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.|But what said she?|Ay.|Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.|You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'|And that set together is noddy.|Now you have taken the pains to set it together, take it for your pains.|No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.|Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.|Why sir, how do you bear with me?|Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing but the word 'noddy' for my pains.|Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.|And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.|Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?|Open your purse, that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered.|Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?|Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.|Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?|Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter: and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as hard as steel.|What said she? nothing?|No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.|Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck, Which cannot perish having thee aboard, Being destined to a drier death on shore. I must go send some better messenger: I fear my Julia would not deign my lines, Receiving them from such a worthless post.|SCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house.|Enter JULlA and LUCETTA|But say, Lucetta, now we are alone, Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?|Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.|Of all the fair resort of gentlemen That every day with parle encounter me, In thy opinion which is worthiest love?|Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind According to my shallow simple skill.|What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?|As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine; But, were I you, he never should be mine.|What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?|Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.|What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?|Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!|How now! what means this passion at his name?|Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame That I, unworthy body as I am, Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.|Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?|Then thus: of many good I think him best.|Your reason?|I have no other, but a woman's reason; I think him so because I think him so.|And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?|Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.|Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.|Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.|His little speaking shows his love but small.|Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.|They do not love that do not show their love.|O, they love least that let men know their love.|I would I knew his mind.|Peruse this paper, madam.|'To Julia.' Say, from whom?|That the contents will show.|Say, say, who gave it thee?|Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus. He would have given it you; but I, being in the way, Did in your name receive it: pardon the fault I pray.|Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker! Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines? To whisper and conspire against my youth? Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth And you an officer fit for the place. Or else return no more into my sight.|To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.|Will ye be gone?|That you may ruminate.|Re-enter LUCETTA|What would your ladyship?|Is't near dinner-time?|I would it were, That you might kill your stomach on your meat And not upon your maid.|What is't that you took up so gingerly?|Nothing.|Why didst thou stoop, then?|To take a paper up that I let fall.|And is that paper nothing?|Nothing concerning me.|Then let it lie for those that it concerns.|Madam, it will not lie where it concerns Unless it have a false interpeter.|Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.|That I might sing it, madam, to a tune. Give me a note: your ladyship can set.|As little by such toys as may be possible. Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'|It is too heavy for so light a tune.|Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?|Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.|And why not you?|I cannot reach so high.|Let's see your song. How now, minion!|Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out: And yet methinks I do not like this tune.|You do not?|No, madam; it is too sharp.|You, minion, are too saucy.|Nay, now you are too flat And mar the concord with too harsh a descant: There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.|The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.|Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.|This babble shall not henceforth trouble me. Here is a coil with protestation! Go get you gone, and let the papers lie: You would be fingering them, to anger me.|She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased To be so anger'd with another letter.|Madam, Dinner is ready, and your father stays.|Well, let us go.|What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?|If you respect them, best to take them up.|Nay, I was taken up for laying them down: Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.|I see you have a month's mind to them.|Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see; I see things too, although you judge I wink.|Come, come; will't please you go?|SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.|Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO|Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?|'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.|Why, what of him?|He wonder'd that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home, While other men, of slender reputation, Put forth their sons to seek preferment out: Some to the wars, to try their fortune there; Some to discover islands far away; Some to the studious universities. For any or for all these exercises, He said that Proteus your son was meet, And did request me to importune you To let him spend his time no more at home, Which would be great impeachment to his age, In having known no travel in his youth.|Nor need'st thou much importune me to that Whereon this month I have been hammering. I have consider'd well his loss of time And how he cannot be a perfect man, Not being tried and tutor'd in the world: Experience is by industry achieved And perfected by the swift course of time. Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?|I think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion, youthful Valentine, Attends the emperor in his royal court.|I know it well.|'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither: There shall he practise tilts and tournaments, Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen. And be in eye of every exercise Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.|I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised: And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it, The execution of it shall make known. Even with the speediest expedition I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.|To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso, With other gentlemen of good esteem, Are journeying to salute the emperor And to commend their service to his will.|Good company; with them shall Proteus go: And, in good time! now will we break with him.|Enter PROTEUS|Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life! Here is her hand, the agent of her heart; Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn. O, that our fathers would applaud our loves, To seal our happiness with their consents! O heavenly Julia!|How now! what letter are you reading there?|May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two Of commendations sent from Valentine, Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.|Lend me the letter; let me see what news.|There is no news, my lord, but that he writes How happily he lives, how well beloved And daily graced by the emperor; Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.|And how stand you affected to his wish?|As one relying on your lordship's will And not depending on his friendly wish.|My will is something sorted with his wish. Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed; For what I will, I will, and there an end. I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time With Valentinus in the emperor's court: What maintenance he from his friends receives, Like exhibition thou shalt have from me. To-morrow be in readiness to go: Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.|My lord, I cannot be so soon provided: Please you, deliberate a day or two.|Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee: No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go. Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd To hasten on his expedition.|Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO|Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning, And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd. I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter, Lest he should take exceptions to my love; And with the vantage of mine own excuse Hath he excepted most against my love. O, how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day, Which now shows all the beauty of the sun, And by and by a cloud takes all away!|Re-enter PANTHINO|Sir Proteus, your father calls for you: He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.|Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto, And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'|II|SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.|Enter VALENTINE and SPEED|Sir, your glove.|Not mine; my gloves are on.|Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.|Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine: Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine! Ah, Silvia, Silvia!|Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!|How now, sirrah?|She is not within hearing, sir.|Why, sir, who bade you call her?|Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.|Well, you'll still be too forward.|And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.|Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?|She that your worship loves?|Why, how know you that I am in love?|Marry, by these special marks: first, you have learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look on you, I can hardly think you my master.|Are all these things perceived in me?|They are all perceived without ye.|Without me? they cannot.|Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you were so simple, none else would: but you are so without these follies, that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.|But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?|She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?|Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.|Why, sir, I know her not.|Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet knowest her not?|Is she not hard-favoured, sir?|Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.|Sir, I know that well enough.|What dost thou know?|That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.|I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.|That's because the one is painted and the other out of all count.|How painted? and how out of count?|Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no man counts of her beauty.|How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.|You never saw her since she was deformed.|How long hath she been deformed?|Ever since you loved her.|I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I see her beautiful.|If you love her, you cannot see her.|Why?|Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes; or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered!|What should I see then?|Your own present folly and her passing deformity: for he, being in love, could not see to garter his hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.|Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.|True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you, you swinged me for my love, which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours.|In conclusion, I stand affected to her.|I would you were set, so your affection would cease.|Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves.|And have you?|I have.|Are they not lamely writ?|No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace! here she comes.|O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet! Now will he interpret to her.|Enter SILVIA|Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.|O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.|Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.|He should give her interest and she gives it him.|As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter Unto the secret nameless friend of yours; Which I was much unwilling to proceed in But for my duty to your ladyship.|I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.|Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off; For being ignorant to whom it goes I writ at random, very doubtfully.|Perchance you think too much of so much pains?|No, madam; so it stead you, I will write Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--|A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel; And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not; And yet take this again; and yet I thank you, Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.|And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'|What means your ladyship? do you not like it?|Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ; But since unwillingly, take them again. Nay, take them.|Madam, they are for you.|Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request; But I will none of them; they are for you; I would have had them writ more movingly.|Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.|And when it's writ, for my sake read it over, And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.|If it please me, madam, what then?|Why, if it please you, take it for your labour: And so, good morrow, servant.|SCENE II. Verona. JULIA'S house.|Enter PROTEUS and JULIA|Have patience, gentle Julia.|I must, where is no remedy.|When possibly I can, I will return.|If you turn not, you will return the sooner. Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.|Giving a ring|Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.|And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.|Here is my hand for my true constancy; And when that hour o'erslips me in the day Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake, The next ensuing hour some foul mischance Torment me for my love's forgetfulness! My father stays my coming; answer not; The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears; That tide will stay me longer than I should. Julia, farewell! What, gone without a word? Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak; For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.|Enter PANTHINO|Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.|Go; I come, I come. Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.|SCENE III. The same. A street.|Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog|Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping; all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I have received my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a great perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam, having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father: no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so, so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing: now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping: now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there 'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.|SCENE IV. Milan. The DUKE's palace.|Enter SILVIA, VALENTINE, THURIO, and SPEED|Servant!|Mistress?|Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.|Ay, boy, it's for love.|Not of you.|Of my mistress, then.|'Twere good you knocked him.|Enter DUKE|Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset. Sir Valentine, your father's in good health: What say you to a letter from your friends Of much good news?|My lord, I will be thankful. To any happy messenger from thence.|Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?|Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman To be of worth and worthy estimation And not without desert so well reputed.|Hath he not a son?|Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves The honour and regard of such a father.|You know him well?|I know him as myself; for from our infancy We have conversed and spent our hours together: And though myself have been an idle truant, Omitting the sweet benefit of time To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection, Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name, Made use and fair advantage of his days; His years but young, but his experience old; His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe; And, in a word, for far behind his worth Comes all the praises that I now bestow, He is complete in feature and in mind With all good grace to grace a gentleman.|Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good, He is as worthy for an empress' love As meet to be an emperor's counsellor. Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me, With commendation from great potentates; And here he means to spend his time awhile: I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.|Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.|Welcome him then according to his worth. Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio; For Valentine, I need not cite him to it: I will send him hither to you presently.|Re-enter THURIO|Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.|I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio, Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome: I'll leave you to confer of home affairs; When you have done, we look to hear from you.|We'll both attend upon your ladyship.|Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO|Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?|Your friends are well and have them much commended.|And how do yours?|I left them all in health.|How does your lady? and how thrives your love?|My tales of love were wont to weary you; I know you joy not in a love discourse.|Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now: I have done penance for contemning Love, Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me With bitter fasts, with penitential groans, With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs; For in revenge of my contempt of love, Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow. O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord, And hath so humbled me, as, I confess, There is no woe to his correction, Nor to his service no such joy on earth. Now no discourse, except it be of love; Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep, Upon the very naked name of love.|Enough; I read your fortune in your eye. Was this the idol that you worship so?|Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?|No; but she is an earthly paragon.|Call her divine.|I will not flatter her.|O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.|When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills, And I must minister the like to you.|Then speak the truth by her; if not divine, Yet let her be a principality, Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.|Except my mistress.|Sweet, except not any; Except thou wilt except against my love.|Have I not reason to prefer mine own?|And I will help thee to prefer her too: She shall be dignified with this high honour-- To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss And, of so great a favour growing proud, Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower And make rough winter everlastingly.|Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?|Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing; She is alone.|Then let her alone.|Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own, And I as rich in having such a jewel As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl, The water nectar and the rocks pure gold. Forgive me that I do not dream on thee, Because thou see'st me dote upon my love. My foolish rival, that her father likes Only for his possessions are so huge, Is gone with her along, and I must after, For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.|But she loves you?|Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our, marriage-hour, With all the cunning manner of our flight, Determined of; how I must climb her window, The ladder made of cords, and all the means Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness. Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber, In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.|Go on before; I shall inquire you forth: I must unto the road, to disembark Some necessaries that I needs must use, And then I'll presently attend you.|Will you make haste?|I will. Even as one heat another heat expels, Or as one nail by strength drives out another, So the remembrance of my former love Is by a newer object quite forgotten. Is it mine, or Valentine's praise, Her true perfection, or my false transgression, That makes me reasonless to reason thus? She is fair; and so is Julia that I love-- That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd; Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire, Bears no impression of the thing it was. Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold, And that I love him not as I was wont. O, but I love his lady too too much, And that's the reason I love him so little. How shall I dote on her with more advice, That thus without advice begin to love her! 'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld, And that hath dazzled my reason's light; But when I look on her perfections, There is no reason but I shall be blind. If I can cheque my erring love, I will; If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.|SCENE V. The same. A street.|Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally|Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!|Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say 'Welcome!'|Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how did thy master part with Madam Julia?|Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very fairly in jest.|But shall she marry him?|No.|How then? shall he marry her?|No, neither.|What, are they broken?|No, they are both as whole as a fish.|Why, then, how stands the matter with them?|Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it stands well with her.|What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.|What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My staff understands me.|What thou sayest?|Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean, and my staff understands me.|It stands under thee, indeed.|Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.|But tell me true, will't be a match?|Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no, it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.|The conclusion is then that it will.|Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.|'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest thou, that my master is become a notable lover?|I never knew him otherwise.|Than how?|A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.|Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.|Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.|I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.|Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse; if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name of a Christian.|Why?|Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?|At thy service.|SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.|SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.|Enter JULIA and LUCETTA|Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me; And even in kind love I do conjure thee, Who art the table wherein all my thoughts Are visibly character'd and engraved, To lesson me and tell me some good mean How, with my honour, I may undertake A journey to my loving Proteus.|Alas, the way is wearisome and long!|A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps; Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly, And when the flight is made to one so dear, Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.|Better forbear till Proteus make return.|O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food? Pity the dearth that I have pined in, By longing for that food so long a time. Didst thou but know the inly touch of love, Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow As seek to quench the fire of love with words.|I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire, But qualify the fire's extreme rage, Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.|The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns. The current that with gentle murmur glides, Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage; But when his fair course is not hindered, He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones, Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge He overtaketh in his pilgrimage, And so by many winding nooks he strays With willing sport to the wild ocean. Then let me go and hinder not my course I'll be as patient as a gentle stream And make a pastime of each weary step, Till the last step have brought me to my love; And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil A blessed soul doth in Elysium.|But in what habit will you go along?|Not like a woman; for I would prevent The loose encounters of lascivious men: Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds As may beseem some well-reputed page.|Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.|No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots. To be fantastic may become a youth Of greater time than I shall show to be.|What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?|That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord, What compass will you wear your farthingale?' Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.|You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.|Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.|A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin, Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.|Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly. But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me For undertaking so unstaid a journey? I fear me, it will make me scandalized.|If you think so, then stay at home and go not.|Nay, that I will not.|Then never dream on infamy, but go. If Proteus like your journey when you come, No matter who's displeased when you are gone: I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.|That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear: A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears And instances of infinite of love Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.|All these are servants to deceitful men.|Base men, that use them to so base effect! But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles, His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate, His tears pure messengers sent from his heart, His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.|Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!|Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong To bear a hard opinion of his truth: Only deserve my love by loving him; And presently go with me to my chamber, To take a note of what I stand in need of, To furnish me upon my longing journey. All that is mine I leave at thy dispose, My goods, my lands, my reputation; Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence. Come, answer not, but to it presently! I am impatient of my tarriance.|III|SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.|Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS|Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile; We have some secrets to confer about. Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?|My gracious lord, that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal; But when I call to mind your gracious favours Done to me, undeserving as I am, My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me. Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend, This night intends to steal away your daughter: Myself am one made privy to the plot. I know you have determined to bestow her On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates; And should she thus be stol'n away from you, It would be much vexation to your age. Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than, by concealing it, heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down, Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.|Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care; Which to requite, command me while I live. This love of theirs myself have often seen, Haply when they have judged me fast asleep, And oftentimes have purposed to forbid Sir Valentine her company and my court: But fearing lest my jealous aim might err And so unworthily disgrace the man, A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd, I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclosed to me. And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this, Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested, I nightly lodge her in an upper tower, The key whereof myself have ever kept; And thence she cannot be convey'd away.|Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean How he her chamber-window will ascend And with a corded ladder fetch her down; For which the youthful lover now is gone And this way comes he with it presently; Where, if it please you, you may intercept him. But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimed at; For love of you, not hate unto my friend, Hath made me publisher of this pretence.|Upon mine honour, he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this.|Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.|Enter VALENTINE|Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?|Please it your grace, there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends, And I am going to deliver them.|Be they of much import?|The tenor of them doth but signify My health and happy being at your court.|Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile; I am to break with thee of some affairs That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret. 'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.|I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter: Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?|No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward, Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty, Neither regarding that she is my child Nor fearing me as if I were her father; And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers, Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her; And, where I thought the remnant of mine age Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty, I now am full resolved to take a wife And turn her out to who will take her in: Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower; For me and my possessions she esteems not.|What would your Grace have me to do in this?|There is a lady in Verona here Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy And nought esteems my aged eloquence: Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor-- For long agone I have forgot to court; Besides, the fashion of the time is changed-- How and which way I may bestow myself To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.|Win her with gifts, if she respect not words: Dumb jewels often in their silent kind More than quick words do move a woman's mind.|But she did scorn a present that I sent her.|A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her. Send her another; never give her o'er; For scorn at first makes after-love the more. If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you, But rather to beget more love in you: If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone; For why, the fools are mad, if left alone. Take no repulse, whatever she doth say; For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!' Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces; Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces. That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man, If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.|But she I mean is promised by her friends Unto a youthful gentleman of worth, And kept severely from resort of men, That no man hath access by day to her.|Why, then, I would resort to her by night.|Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe, That no man hath recourse to her by night.|What lets but one may enter at her window?|Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground, And built so shelving that one cannot climb it Without apparent hazard of his life.|Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords, To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks, Would serve to scale another Hero's tower, So bold Leander would adventure it.|Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood, Advise me where I may have such a ladder.|When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.|This very night; for Love is like a child, That longs for every thing that he can come by.|By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.|But, hark thee; I will go to her alone: How shall I best convey the ladder thither?|It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it Under a cloak that is of any length.|A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?|Ay, my good lord.|Then let me see thy cloak: I'll get me one of such another length.|Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.|How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak? I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me. What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'! And here an engine fit for my proceeding. I'll be so bold to break the seal for once. 'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly, And slaves they are to me that send them flying: O, could their master come and go as lightly, Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying! My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them: While I, their king, that hither them importune, Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them, Because myself do want my servants' fortune: I curse myself, for they are sent by me, That they should harbour where their lord would be.' What's here? 'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.' 'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose. Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,-- Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car And with thy daring folly burn the world? Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee? Go, base intruder! overweening slave! Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates, And think my patience, more than thy desert, Is privilege for thy departure hence: Thank me for this more than for all the favours Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee. But if thou linger in my territories Longer than swiftest expedition Will give thee time to leave our royal court, By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love I ever bore my daughter or thyself. Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse; But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.|Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE|Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.|Soho, soho!|What seest thou?|Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head but 'tis a Valentine.|Valentine?|No.|Who then? his spirit?|Neither.|What then?|Nothing.|Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?|Who wouldst thou strike?|Nothing.|Villain, forbear.|Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--|Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.|My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news, So much of bad already hath possess'd them.|Then in dumb silence will I bury mine, For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.|Is Silvia dead?|No, Valentine.|No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia. Hath she forsworn me?|No, Valentine.|No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me. What is your news?|Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.|That thou art banished--O, that's the news!-- From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.|O, I have fed upon this woe already, And now excess of it will make me surfeit. Doth Silvia know that I am banished?|Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom-- Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force-- A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears: Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd; With them, upon her knees, her humble self; Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them As if but now they waxed pale for woe: But neither bended knees, pure hands held up, Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears, Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire; But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die. Besides, her intercession chafed him so, When she for thy repeal was suppliant, That to close prison he commanded her, With many bitter threats of biding there.|No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st Have some malignant power upon my life: If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear, As ending anthem of my endless dolour.|Cease to lament for that thou canst not help, And study help for that which thou lament'st. Time is the nurse and breeder of all good. Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love; Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life. Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that And manage it against despairing thoughts. Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence; Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love. The time now serves not to expostulate: Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate; And, ere I part with thee, confer at large Of all that may concern thy love-affairs. As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself, Regard thy danger, and along with me!|I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy, Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.|Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.|O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!|Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS|I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who 'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet 'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel; which is much in a bare Christian. Here is the cate-log of her condition. 'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item: She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands.|SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.|Enter DUKE and THURIO|Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you, Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.|Since his exile she hath despised me most, Forsworn my company and rail'd at me, That I am desperate of obtaining her.|This weak impress of love is as a figure Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat Dissolves to water and doth lose his form. A little time will melt her frozen thoughts And worthless Valentine shall be forgot. How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman According to our proclamation gone?|Gone, my good lord.|My daughter takes his going grievously.|A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.|So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so. Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee-- For thou hast shown some sign of good desert-- Makes me the better to confer with thee.|Longer than I prove loyal to your grace Let me not live to look upon your grace.|Thou know'st how willingly I would effect The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.|I do, my lord.|And also, I think, thou art not ignorant How she opposes her against my will|She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.|Ay, and perversely she persevers so. What might we do to make the girl forget The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?|The best way is to slander Valentine With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent, Three things that women highly hold in hate.|Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.|Ay, if his enemy deliver it: Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.|Then you must undertake to slander him.|And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do: 'Tis an ill office for a gentleman, Especially against his very friend.|Where your good word cannot advantage him, Your slander never can endamage him; Therefore the office is indifferent, Being entreated to it by your friend.|You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it By ought that I can speak in his dispraise, She shall not long continue love to him. But say this weed her love from Valentine, It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.|Therefore, as you unwind her love from him, Lest it should ravel and be good to none, You must provide to bottom it on me; Which must be done by praising me as much As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.|And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind, Because we know, on Valentine's report, You are already Love's firm votary And cannot soon revolt and change your mind. Upon this warrant shall you have access Where you with Silvia may confer at large; For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy, And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you; Where you may temper her by your persuasion To hate young Valentine and love my friend.|As much as I can do, I will effect: But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough; You must lay lime to tangle her desires By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.|Ay, Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.|Say that upon the altar of her beauty You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart: Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears Moist it again, and frame some feeling line That may discover such integrity: For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews, Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones, Make tigers tame and huge leviathans Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands. After your dire-lamenting elegies, Visit by night your lady's chamber-window With some sweet concert; to their instruments Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance. This, or else nothing, will inherit her.|This discipline shows thou hast been in love.|And thy advice this night I'll put in practise. Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver, Let us into the city presently To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music. I have a sonnet that will serve the turn To give the onset to thy good advice.|About it, gentlemen!|We'll wait upon your grace till after supper, And afterward determine our proceedings.|Even now about it! I will pardon you.|IV|SCENE I. The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.|Enter certain Outlaws|Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.|If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.|SCENE II. Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber.|Enter THURIO and Musicians|How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?|Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love Will creep in service where it cannot go.|Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.|Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.|Who? Silvia?|Ay, Silvia; for your sake.|I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen, Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.|Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes|Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I pray you, why is it?|Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.|Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.|But shall I hear him speak?|Ay, that you shall.|That will be music.|Music plays|Hark, hark!|Is he among these?|Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em. Who is Silvia? what is she, That all our swains commend her? Holy, fair and wise is she; The heaven such grace did lend her, That she might admired be. Is she kind as she is fair? For beauty lives with kindness. Love doth to her eyes repair, To help him of his blindness, And, being help'd, inhabits there. Then to Silvia let us sing, That Silvia is excelling; She excels each mortal thing Upon the dull earth dwelling: To her let us garlands bring.|How now! are you sadder than you were before? How do you, man? the music likes you not.|You mistake; the musician likes me not.|Why, my pretty youth?|He plays false, father.|How? out of tune on the strings?|Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very heart-strings.|You have a quick ear.|Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.|I perceive you delight not in music.|Not a whit, when it jars so.|Hark, what fine change is in the music!|Ay, that change is the spite.|You would have them always play but one thing?|I would always have one play but one thing. But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on Often resort unto this gentlewoman?|I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved her out of all nick.|Where is Launce?|Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.|Peace! stand aside: the company parts.|Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead That you shall say my cunning drift excels.|Where meet we?|At Saint Gregory's well.|Farewell.|Enter SILVIA above|Madam, good even to your ladyship.|I thank you for your music, gentlemen. Who is that that spake?|One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth, You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.|Sir Proteus, as I take it.|Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.|What's your will?|That I may compass yours.|You have your wish; my will is even this: That presently you hie you home to bed. Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man! Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless, To be seduced by thy flattery, That hast deceived so many with thy vows? Return, return, and make thy love amends. For me, by this pale queen of night I swear, I am so far from granting thy request That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit, And by and by intend to chide myself Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.|I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady; But she is dead.|'Twere false, if I should speak it; For I am sure she is not buried.|Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend Survives; to whom, thyself art witness, I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed To wrong him with thy importunacy?|I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.|And so suppose am I; for in his grave Assure thyself my love is buried.|Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.|Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence, Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.|He heard not that.|Madam, if your heart be so obdurate, Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love, The picture that is hanging in your chamber; To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep: For since the substance of your perfect self Is else devoted, I am but a shadow; And to your shadow will I make true love.|If 'twere a substance, you would, sure, deceive it, And make it but a shadow, as I am.|I am very loath to be your idol, sir; But since your falsehood shall become you well To worship shadows and adore false shapes, Send to me in the morning and I'll send it: And so, good rest.|As wretches have o'ernight That wait for execution in the morn.|Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally|Host, will you go?|By my halidom, I was fast asleep.|Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?|Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost day.|Not so; but it hath been the longest night That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.|SCENE III. The same.|Enter EGLAMOUR|This is the hour that Madam Silvia Entreated me to call and know her mind: There's some great matter she'ld employ me in. Madam, madam!|SCENE IV. The same.|Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog|When a man's servant shall play the cur with him, look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it. I have taught him, even as one would say precisely, 'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg: O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as one should say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did, I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke. I, having been acquainted with the smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out of the chamber. How many masters would do this for his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't. Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst thou ever see me do such a trick?|Exit SILVIA, with attendants|And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her. A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful I hope my master's suit will be but cold, Since she respects my mistress' love so much. Alas, how love can trifle with itself! Here is her picture: let me see; I think, If I had such a tire, this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers: And yet the painter flatter'd her a little, Unless I flatter with myself too much. Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow: If that be all the difference in his love, I'll get me such a colour'd periwig. Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine: Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high. What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself, If this fond Love were not a blinded god? Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up, For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form, Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored! And, were there sense in his idolatry, My substance should be statue in thy stead. I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake, That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow, I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes To make my master out of love with thee!|V|SCENE I. Milan. An abbey.|SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.|Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA|Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?|O, sir, I find her milder than she was; And yet she takes exceptions at your person.|What, that my leg is too long?|No; that it is too little.|I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.|But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes.|What says she to my face?|She says it is a fair one.|Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.|But pearls are fair; and the old saying is, Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.|'Tis true; such pearls as put out ladies' eyes; For I had rather wink than look on them.|How likes she my discourse?|Ill, when you talk of war.|But well, when I discourse of love and peace?|But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.|What says she to my valour?|O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.|She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.|What says she to my birth?|That you are well derived.|True; from a gentleman to a fool.|Considers she my possessions?|O, ay; and pities them.|Wherefore?|That such an ass should owe them.|That they are out by lease.|Here comes the duke.|SCENE III. The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.|Enter Outlaws with SILVIA|Come, come, Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.|A thousand more mischances than this one Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.|Come, bring her away.|Where is the gentleman that was with her?|Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us, But Moyses and Valerius follow him. Go thou with her to the west end of the wood; There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled; The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.|Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave: Fear not; he bears an honourable mind, And will not use a woman lawlessly.|O Valentine, this I endure for thee!|SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.|Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA|Madam, this service I have done for you, Though you respect not aught your servant doth, To hazard life and rescue you from him That would have forced your honour and your love; Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look; A smaller boon than this I cannot beg And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.|How like a dream is this I see and hear! Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.|O miserable, unhappy that I am!|Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came; But by my coming I have made you happy.|By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.|And me, when he approacheth to your presence.|Had I been seized by a hungry lion, I would have been a breakfast to the beast, Rather than have false Proteus rescue me. O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine, Whose life's as tender to me as my soul! And full as much, for more there cannot be, I do detest false perjured Proteus. Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.|What dangerous action, stood it next to death, Would I not undergo for one calm look! O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved, When women cannot love where they're beloved!|When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved. Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love, For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths Descended into perjury, to love me. Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two; And that's far worse than none; better have none Than plural faith which is too much by one: Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!|In love Who respects friend?|All men but Proteus.|Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words Can no way change you to a milder form, I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end, And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.|O heaven!|I'll force thee yield to my desire.|Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch, Thou friend of an ill fashion!|Valentine!|Thou common friend, that's without faith or love, For such is a friend now; treacherous man! Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me. Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus, I am sorry I must never trust thee more, But count the world a stranger for thy sake. The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst, 'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!|My shame and guilt confounds me. Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow Be a sufficient ransom for offence, I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer As e'er I did commit.|Then I am paid; And once again I do receive thee honest. Who by repentance is not satisfied Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased. By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased: And, that my love may appear plain and free, All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.|O me unhappy!|Swoons|Look to the boy.|Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter? Look up; speak.|O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.|Where is that ring, boy?|Here 'tis; this is it.|How! let me see: Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.|O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook: This is the ring you sent to Silvia.|But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart I gave this unto Julia.|And Julia herself did give it me; And Julia herself hath brought it hither.|How! Julia!|Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths, And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart. How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root! O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush! Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me Such an immodest raiment, if shame live In a disguise of love: It is the lesser blot, modesty finds, Women to change their shapes than men their minds.|Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven! were man But constant, he were perfect. That one error Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins: Inconstancy falls off ere it begins. What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?|Come, come, a hand from either: Let me be blest to make this happy close; 'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.|Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.|And I mine.|Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO|A prize, a prize, a prize!|Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke. Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced, Banished Valentine.|Sir Valentine!|Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.|Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death; Come not within the measure of my wrath; Do not name Silvia thine; if once again, Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands; Take but possession of her with a touch: I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.|Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I; I hold him but a fool that will endanger His body for a girl that loves him not: I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.|The more degenerate and base art thou, To make such means for her as thou hast done And leave her on such slight conditions. Now, by the honour of my ancestry, I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine, And think thee worthy of an empress' love: Know then, I here forget all former griefs, Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again, Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit, To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine, Thou art a gentleman and well derived; Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.|I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy. I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake, To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.|I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.|These banish'd men that I have kept withal Are men endued with worthy qualities: Forgive them what they have committed here And let them be recall'd from their exile: They are reformed, civil, full of good And fit for great employment, worthy lord.|Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee: Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts. Come, let us go: we will include all jars With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.|And, as we walk along, I dare be bold With our discourse to make your grace to smile. What think you of this page, my lord?|I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.|I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.|What mean you by that saying?|Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along, That you will wonder what hath fortuned. Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear The story of your loves discovered: That done, our day of marriage shall be yours; One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.|
