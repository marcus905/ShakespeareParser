Venice. A street.</title><speeches><stagedir>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</stagedir><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
I am to learn;
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
That I have much ado to know myself.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALARINO</persona><text>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
There, where your argosies with portly sail,
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
As they fly by them with their woven wings.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALANIO</persona><text>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
The better part of my affections would
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
And every object that might make me fear
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
Would make me sad.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALARINO</persona><text>My wind cooling my broth
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
But I should think of shallows and of flats,
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
And see the holy edifice of stone,
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
And, in a word, but even now worth this,
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
But tell not me; I know, Antonio
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
Upon the fortune of this present year:
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALARINO</persona><text>Why, then you are in love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Fie, fie!
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALARINO</persona><text>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
And other of such vinegar aspect
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</stagedir><speech><persona>SALANIO</persona><text>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
We leave you now with better company.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALARINO</persona><text>I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
If worthier friends had not prevented me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Your worth is very dear in my regard.
I take it, your own business calls on you
And you embrace the occasion to depart.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALARINO</persona><text>Good morrow, my good lords.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALARINO</persona><text>We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt Salarino and Salanio</stagedir><speech><persona>LORENZO</persona><text>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>I will not fail you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>You look not well, Signior Antonio;
You have too much respect upon the world:
They lose it that do buy it with much care:
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
A stage where every man must play a part,
And mine a sad one.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>Let me play the fool:
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
And let my liver rather heat with wine
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
There are a sort of men whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
O my Antonio, I do know of these
That therefore only are reputed wise
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
I'll tell thee more of this another time:
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORENZO</persona><text>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
For Gratiano never lets me speak.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>Well, keep me company but two years moe,
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</stagedir><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Is that any thing now?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
have them, they are not worth the search.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Well, tell me now what lady is the same
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
That you to-day promised to tell me of?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
How much I have disabled mine estate,
By something showing a more swelling port
Than my faint means would grant continuance:
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
From such a noble rate; but my chief care
Is to come fairly off from the great debts
Wherein my time something too prodigal
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
I owe the most, in money and in love,
And from your love I have a warranty
To unburden all my plots and purposes
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
Within the eye of honour, be assured,
My purse, my person, my extremest means,
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
The self-same way with more advised watch,
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
Because what follows is pure innocence.
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
That which I owe is lost; but if you please
To shoot another arrow that self way
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
As I will watch the aim, or to find both
Or bring your latter hazard back again
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>You know me well, and herein spend but time
To wind about my love with circumstance;
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
In making question of my uttermost
Than if you had made waste of all I have:
Then do but say to me what I should do
That in your knowledge may by me be done,
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>In Belmont is a lady richly left;
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
I did receive fair speechless messages:
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
For the four winds blow in from every coast
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
And many Jasons come in quest of her.
O my Antonio, had I but the means
To hold a rival place with one of them,
I have a mind presages me such thrift,
That I should questionless be fortunate!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
Neither have I money nor commodity
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
Try what my credit can in Venice do:
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
Where money is, and I no question make
To have it of my trust or for my sake.
</text></speech></speeches></scene><scene><title>SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</title><speeches><stagedir>Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</stagedir><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
this great world.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
competency lives longer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Good sentences and well pronounced.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>They would be better, if well followed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
them, I will describe them; and, according to my
description, level at my affection.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>Then there is the County Palatine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these. God defend me from these
two!
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
he! why, he hath a horse better than the
Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
shall never requite him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
of England?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
behavior every where.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
make shift to go without him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
will, if you should refuse to accept him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
for if the devil be within and that temptation
without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
lords: they have acquainted me with their
determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
you may be won by some other sort than your father's
imposition depending on the caskets.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
them a fair departure.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
thy praise.
How now! what news?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Servant</persona><text>The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
prince his master will be here to-night.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
Whiles we shut the gates
upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.

</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Ay, sir, for three months.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>For three months; well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Antonio shall become bound; well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
know your answer?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Your answer to that.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Antonio is a good man.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
good man is to have you understand me that he is
sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
take his bond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Be assured you may.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>If it please you to dine with us.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter ANTONIO</stagedir><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>This is Signior Antonio.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>  How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him for he is a Christian,
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
If I forgive him!
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Shylock, do you hear?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>I am debating of my present store,
And, by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
Do you desire?
Rest you fair, good signior;
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>And for three months.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>I do never use it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>And what of him? did he take interest?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
And, when the work of generation was
Between these woolly breeders in the act,
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
But note me, signior.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Mark you this, Bassanio,
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
In the Rialto you have rated me
About my moneys and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
What should I say to you? Should I not say
'Hath a dog money? is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
You spurn'd me such a day; another time
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Why, look you, how you storm!
I would be friends with you and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
Supply your present wants and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
This is kind I offer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>This were kindness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are

A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine

Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice

this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;
take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,
indeed, my father did something smack, something
grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are
at your command; I will run.

</text></speech><speech><persona>MOROCCO</persona><text>The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
The second, silver, which this promise carries,
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
How shall I know if I do choose the right?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>The one of them contains my picture, prince:
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOROCCO</persona><text>Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
I will survey the inscriptions back again.
What says this leaden casket?
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
Do it in hope of fair advantages:
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
What says the silver with her virgin hue?
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
And weigh thy value with an even hand:
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
May not extend so far as to the lady:
And yet to be afeard of my deserving
Were but a weak disabling of myself.
As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
In graces and in qualities of breeding;
But more than these, in love I do deserve.
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
From the four corners of the earth they come,
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
For princes to come view fair Portia:
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
To think so base a thought: it were too gross
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
A coin that bears the figure of an angel
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
But here an angel in a golden bed
Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
All that glitters is not gold;
Often have you heard that told:
Many a man his life hath sold
But my outside to behold:
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
Had you been as wise as bold,
Young in limbs, in judgment old,
Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
Fare you well; your suit is cold.
Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!

To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.

A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!

Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'

I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
The French and English, there miscarried
A vessel of our country richly fraught:
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.

Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALARINO</persona><text>A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
Bassanio told him he would make some speed
Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
But stay the very riping of the time;
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
Let it not enter in your mind of love:
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
To courtship and such fair ostents of love
As shall conveniently become you there:'
And even there, his eye being big with tears,
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
And with affection wondrous sensible
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.

Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;

Builds in the weather on the outward wall,

Because I will not jump with common spirits
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.

Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
And well said too; for who shall go about
To cozen fortune and be honourable
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
To wear an undeserved dignity.
O, that estates, degrees and offices
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
How many then should cover that stand bare!
How many be commanded that command!
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:

The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
And these assume but valour's excrement

Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
Upon supposed fairness, often known

The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
The seeming truth which cunning times put on
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge

Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
The painter plays the spider and hath woven
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
How could he see to do them? having made one,
Methinks it should have power to steal both his
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
In underprizing it, so far this shadow
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
The continent and summary of my fortune.
You that choose not by the view,
Chance as fair and choose as true!
Since this fortune falls to you,
Be content and seek no new,
If you be well pleased with this
And hold your fortune for your bliss,
Turn you where your lady is
And claim her with a loving kiss.
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
I come by note, to give and to receive.
Like one of two contending in a prize,
That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
Hearing applause and universal shout,
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
As doubtful whether what I see be true,
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
Such as I am: though for myself alone
I would not be ambitious in my wish,
To wish myself much better; yet, for you
I would be trebled twenty times myself;
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
That only to stand high in your account,
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
Exceed account; but the full sum of me
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
Happy in this, she is not yet so old
But she may learn; happier than this,
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
Commits itself to yours to be directed,
As from her lord, her governor, her king.
Myself and what is mine to you and yours
Is now converted: but now I was the lord
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
This house, these servants and this same myself
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
Let it presage the ruin of your love
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
And there is such confusion in my powers,
As after some oration fairly spoke
By a beloved prince, there doth appear
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
Where every something, being blent together,
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!

I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
For I am sure you can wish none from me:
And when your honours mean to solemnize

Even at that time I may be married too.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
You loved, I loved for intermission.
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
For wooing here until I sweat again,
And sweating until my very roof was dry
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
I got a promise of this fair one here
To have her love, provided that your fortune
Achieved her mistress.

</text></speech><speech><persona>SALERIO</persona><text>I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
Could turn so much the constitution
Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
And I must freely have the half of anything
That this same paper brings you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>O sweet Portia,
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
When I did first impart my love to you,
I freely told you, all the wealth I had
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
How much I was a braggart. When I told you
My state was nothing, I should then have told you
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
The paper as the body of my friend,
And every word in it a gaping wound,
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
Of merchant-marring rocks?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SALERIO</persona><text>Not one, my lord.
Besides, it should appear, that if he had
The present money to discharge the Jew,
He would not take it. Never did I know
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
So keen and greedy to confound a man:
He plies the duke at morning and at night,
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
The duke himself, and the magnificoes
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
But none can drive him from the envious plea
Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>JESSICA</persona><text>When I was with him I have heard him swear
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
Than twenty times the value of the sum
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
If law, authority and power deny not,
It will go hard with poor Antonio.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
In doing courtesies, and one in whom
The ancient Roman honour more appears
Than any that draws breath in Italy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>What sum owes he the Jew?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>For me three thousand ducats.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>What, no more?
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
Double six thousand, and then treble that,
Before a friend of this description
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
First go with me to church and call me wife,
And then away to Venice to your friend;
For never shall you lie by Portia's side
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
But let me hear the letter of your friend.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
let not my letter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Since I have your good leave to go away,

No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

Which makes me think that this Antonio,
Being the bosom lover of my lord,
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
How little is the cost I have bestow'd
In purchasing the semblance of my soul
From out the state of hellish misery!
This comes too near the praising of myself;
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.

Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice

Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back,
Enow to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,

As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
Must yield to such inevitable shame
As to offend, himself being offended;

It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Is he not able to discharge the money?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority:
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not for Venice.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>When it is paid according to the tenor.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Most heartily I do beseech the court
To give the judgment.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Why then, thus it is:
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>O noble judge! O excellent young man!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty,
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Therefore lay bare your bosom.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Ay, his breast:
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
The flesh?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>I have them ready.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Is it so nominated in the bond?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>It is not so express'd: but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much for charity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
I would she were in heaven, so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
The wish would make else an unquiet house.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
Would any of the stock of Barrabas
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Most rightful judge!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Tarry a little; there is something else.
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
Unto the state of Venice.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Is that the law?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Thyself shalt see the act:
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
And let the Christian go.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Here is the money.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Soft!
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
He shall have nothing but the penalty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
But in the estimation of a hair,
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Give me my principal, and let me go.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>I have it ready for thee; here it is.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>He hath refused it in the open court:
He shall have merely justice and his bond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Shall I not have barely my principal?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Why, then the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Tarry, Jew:
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen,
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly and directly too
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE</persona><text>That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state,
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
You take my house when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house; you take my life
When you do take the means whereby I live.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>So please my lord the duke and all the court
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
I am content; so he will let me have
The other half in use, to render it,
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter:
Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift,
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE</persona><text>He shall do this, or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>I am content.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHYLOCK</persona><text>I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
I am not well: send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE</persona><text>Get thee gone, but do it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:

To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.

In love and service to you evermore.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>He is well paid that is well satisfied;
And I, delivering you, am satisfied
And therein do account myself well paid:
My mind was never yet more mercenary.
I pray you, know me when we meet again:
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
And you in love shall not deny me this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
I will not shame myself to give you this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>I will have nothing else but only this;
And now methinks I have a mind to it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>There's more depends on this than on the value.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
And find it out by proclamation:
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
And when she put it on, she made me vow
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
And know how well I have deserved the ring,
She would not hold out enemy for ever,
For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt Portia and Nerissa</stagedir><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:

Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,

Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.

It must appear in other ways than words,
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
That she did give me, whose posy was
For all the world like cutler's poetry
Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>What talk you of the posy or the value?
You swore to me, when I did give it you,
That you would wear it till your hour of death
And that it should lie with you in your grave:
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
You should have been respective and have kept it.
Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>He will, an if he live to be a man.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
I could not for my heart deny it him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
I gave my love a ring and made him swear
Never to part with it; and here he stands;
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
And swear I lost the ring defending it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
And neither man nor master would take aught
But the two rings.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>What ring gave you my lord?
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>If I could add a lie unto a fault,
I would deny it; but you see my finger
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Even so void is your false heart of truth.
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
Until I see the ring.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>Nor I in yours
Till I again see mine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Sweet Portia,
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
If you did know for whom I gave the ring
And would conceive for what I gave the ring
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
When nought would be accepted but the ring,
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>If you had known the virtue of the ring,
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
Or your own honour to contain the ring,
You would not then have parted with the ring.
What man is there so much unreasonable,
If you had pleased to have defended it
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
Even he that did uphold the very life
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
I was enforced to send it after him;
I was beset with shame and courtesy;
My honour would not let ingratitude
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
For, by these blessed candles of the night,
Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
And that which you did swear to keep for me,
I will become as liberal as you;
I'll not deny him any thing I have,
No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
If you do not, if I be left alone,
Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
How you do leave me to mine own protection.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
And, in the hearing of these many friends,
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
Wherein I see myself--
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Mark you but that!
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
And there's an oath of credit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Nay, but hear me:
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
I never more will break an oath with thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>I once did lend my body for his wealth;
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
Will never more break faith advisedly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
And bid him keep it better than the other.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>Why, this is like the mending of highways
In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
And even but now return'd; I have not yet
Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
And I have better news in store for you
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
There you shall find three of your argosies
Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
You shall not know by what strange accident
I chanced on this letter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>I am dumb.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
Unless he live until he be a man.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BASSANIO</persona><text>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONIO</persona><text>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
For here I read for certain that my ships
Are safely come to road.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>How now, Lorenzo!
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NERISSA</persona><text>Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
There do I give to you and Jessica,
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORENZO</persona><text>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
Of starved people.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>It is almost morning,
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
Of these events at full. Let us go in;
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
And we will answer all things faithfully.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GRATIANO</persona><text>Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
