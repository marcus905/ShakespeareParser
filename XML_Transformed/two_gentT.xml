An open place.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
Were't not affection chains thy tender days
To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
I rather would entreat thy company
To see the wonders of the world abroad,
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
Even as I would when I to love begin.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
Wish me partaker in thy happiness
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
If ever danger do environ thee,
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>And on a love-book pray for my success?

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>That's on some shallow story of deep love:
How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>That's a deep story of a deeper love:
For he was more than over shoes in love.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>What?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
However, but a folly bought with wit,
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>Love is your master, for he masters you:
And he that is so yoked by a fool,
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
The eating canker dwells, so eating love
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>And writers say, as the most forward bud
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
Even so by love the young and tender wit
Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
Losing his verdure even in the prime
And all the fair effects of future hopes.
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
That art a votary to fond desire?
Once more adieu! my father at the road
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.

To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
Of thy success in love, and what news else
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
And likewise will visit thee with mine.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>He after honour hunts, I after love:
He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
An if the shepherd be a while away.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>This proves me still a sheep.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>True; and thy master a shepherd.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
not me: therefore I am no sheep.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for

follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
lost mutton, nothing for my labour.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
carrying your letter.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
your lover.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>But what said she?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>  Ay.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>And that set together is noddy.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
take it for your pains.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Why sir, how do you bear with me?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
be both at once delivered.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,
not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
hard as steel.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>What said she? nothing?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>SPEED</persona><text>No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter SPEED</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Verona. An open place.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
Being destined to a drier death on shore.
I must go send some better messenger:
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
Receiving them from such a worthless post.

It were a shame to call her back again
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
And would not force the letter to my view!
Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
When willingly I would have had her here!
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
My penance is to call Lucetta back
And ask remission for my folly past.
What ho! Lucetta!

O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
Till I have found each letter in the letter,
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
And throw it thence into the raging sea!
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
And yet I will not, sith so prettily
He couples it to his complaining names.
Thus will I fold them one on another:
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.

Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
Some to discover islands far away;
Some to the studious universities.
For any or for all these exercises,
He said that Proteus your son was meet,
And did request me to importune you
To let him spend his time no more at home,
Which would be great impeachment to his age,
In having known no travel in his youth.

the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look

wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,
having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my
parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This
shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:
no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my
sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.

His years but young, but his experience old;
His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;

Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
He is complete in feature and in mind
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.

I have done penance for contemning Love,
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
For in revenge of my contempt of love,
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
There is no woe to his correction,
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
Now no discourse, except it be of love;
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
Upon the very naked name of love.

She shall be dignified with this high honour--
To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss

Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
And make rough winter everlastingly.

She is alone.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Milan. The DUKE's palace.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Then let her alone.

And I as rich in having such a jewel
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
My foolish rival, that her father likes
Only for his possessions are so huge,
Is gone with her along, and I must after,
For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Milan. The DUKE's palace.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>But she loves you?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Milan. The DUKE's palace.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
marriage-hour,
With all the cunning manner of our flight,
Determined of; how I must climb her window,
The ladder made of cords, and all the means
Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Milan. The DUKE's palace.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
I must unto the road, to disembark
Some necessaries that I needs must use,
And then I'll presently attend you.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Milan. The DUKE's palace.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>Will you make haste?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Milan. The DUKE's palace.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>I will.
Even as one heat another heat expels,
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
So the remembrance of my former love
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
Bears no impression of the thing it was.
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
And that I love him not as I was wont.
O, but I love his lady too too much,
And that's the reason I love him so little.
How shall I dote on her with more advice,
That thus without advice begin to love her!
'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
But when I look on her perfections,
There is no reason but I shall be blind.
If I can cheque my erring love, I will;
If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.

To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
And even that power which gave me first my oath
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
At first I did adore a twinkling star,
But now I worship a celestial sun.
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
And he wants wit that wants resolved will
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
But there I leave to love where I should love.
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
I to myself am dearer than a friend,
For love is still most precious in itself;
And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
I will forget that Julia is alive,
Remembering that my love to her is dead;
And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
I cannot now prove constant to myself,
Without some treachery used to Valentine.
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
Myself in counsel, his competitor.
Now presently I'll give her father notice
Of their disguising and pretended flight;
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!

The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
But when I call to mind your gracious favours
Done to me, undeserving as I am,
My duty pricks me on to utter that
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
This night intends to steal away your daughter:
Myself am one made privy to the plot.
I know you have determined to bestow her
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
It would be much vexation to your age.
Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
To cross my friend in his intended drift
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.

Which to requite, command me while I live.
This love of theirs myself have often seen,
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
Sir Valentine her company and my court:
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
And so unworthily disgrace the man,
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
The key whereof myself have ever kept;
And thence she cannot be convey'd away.

For which the youthful lover now is gone

But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly

For love of you, not hate unto my friend,

Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter VALENTINE</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Milan. The DUKE's palace.</sceneN><persona>DUKE</persona><text>No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
Neither regarding that she is my child
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
I now am full resolved to take a wife
And turn her out to who will take her in:
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
For me and my possessions she esteems not.

But rather to beget more love in you:
If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.

If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.

What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
O, could their master come and go as lightly,
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
While I, their king, that hither them importune,
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
What's here?
'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
And with thy daring folly burn the world?
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
And think my patience, more than thy desert,
Is privilege for thy departure hence:
Thank me for this more than for all the favours
Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
But if thou linger in my territories
Longer than swiftest expedition
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  Milan. The DUKE's palace.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>And why not death rather than living torment?
To die is to be banish'd from myself;
And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
Unless it be to think that she is by
And feed upon the shadow of perfection
Except I be by Silvia in the night,
There is no music in the nightingale;
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
There is no day for me to look upon;
She is my essence, and I leave to be,
If I be not by her fair influence
Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.

'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse
can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only
carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:
She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid
with clean hands.

For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;

That may discover such integrity:
For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
After your dire-lamenting elegies,
Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
With some sweet concert; to their instruments
Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.

in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you
wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
thou ever see me do such a trick?

A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
That with his very heart despiseth me?
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
Because I love him I must pity him.
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
To bind him to remember my good will;
And now am I, unhappy messenger,
To plead for that which I would not obtain,
To carry that which I would have refused,
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
I am my master's true-confirmed love;
But cannot be true servant to my master,
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.

When she did think my master loved her well,
She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
But since she did neglect her looking-glass
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
That now she is become as black as I.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  The same.</sceneN><persona>SILVIA</persona><text>How tall was she?

When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
As if the garment had been made for me:
Therefore I know she is about my height.
And at that time I made her weep agood,
For I did play a lamentable part:
Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
Which I so lively acted with my tears
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  The same.</sceneN><persona>SILVIA</persona><text>She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
I weep myself to think upon thy words.
Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
Farewell.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit SILVIA, with attendants</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  The same.</sceneN><persona>JULIA</persona><text>And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
If I had such a tire, this face of mine
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
Unless I flatter with myself too much.
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
If that be all the difference in his love,
I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
What should it be that he respects in her
But I can make respective in myself,
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
And, were there sense in his idolatry,
My substance should be statue in thy stead.
I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
To make my master out of love with thee!

I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
And full as much, for more there cannot be,
I do detest false perjured Proteus.
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.

Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
Descended into perjury, to love me.
Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
And that's far worse than none; better have none
Than plural faith which is too much by one:
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!

Can no way change you to a milder form,

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>My shame and guilt confounds me.
Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
As e'er I did commit.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>Then I am paid;
And once again I do receive thee honest.
Who by repentance is not satisfied
Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
And, that my love may appear plain and free,
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.

Look up; speak.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>JULIA</persona><text>O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>JULIA</persona><text>Here 'tis; this is it.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>How! let me see:
Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>JULIA</persona><text>O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
I gave this unto Julia.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>JULIA</persona><text>And Julia herself did give it me;
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>How! Julia!
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>JULIA</persona><text>Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
In a disguise of love:
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>PROTEUS</persona><text>Than men their minds! 'tis true.
O heaven! were man
But constant, he were perfect. That one error
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Swoons</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>VALENTINE</persona><text>Come, come, a hand from either:
Let me be blest to make this happy close;

Come not within the measure of my wrath;
Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
Take but possession of her with a touch:
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.

I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE IV.  Another part of the forest.</sceneN><persona>DUKE</persona><text>The more degenerate and base art thou,
To make such means for her as thou hast done
And leave her on such slight conditions.
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.

Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
The story of your loves discovered:
That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
