</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.

</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;
it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
man, and signifies love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.

</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,
there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
benevolence to make atonements and compremises
between you.

is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
Page, which is pretty virginity.

</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
peat the door for Master Page.

</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>You'll not confess, you'll not confess.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault;

</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that
so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert

</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL</stagedir><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and
broke open my lodge.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>But not kissed your keeper's daughter?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
That is now answered.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>The council shall know this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:
you'll be laughed at.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
head: what matter have you against me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;
and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
Nym, and Pistol.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BARDOLPH</persona><text>You Banbury cheese!
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Ay, it is no matter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PISTOL</persona><text>How now, Mephostophilus!
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Ay, it is no matter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NYM</persona><text>Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that
is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>We three, to hear it and end it between them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-
book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
as great discreetly as we can.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>Pistol!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PISTOL</persona><text>He hears with ears.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He
hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might
never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>Is this true, Pistol?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PISTOL</persona><text>Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
Word of denial in thy labras here!
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>By these gloves, then, 'twas he.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NYM</persona><text>Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say
'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
humour on me; that is the very note of it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>What say you, Scarlet and John?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BARDOLPH</persona><text>Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
himself out of his five sentences.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!
</text></speech><speech><persona>BARDOLPH</persona><text>And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and
so conclusions passed the careires.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no
matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,
but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have
the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD
and MISTRESS PAGE, following</stagedir><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exit ANNE PAGE</stagedir><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>How now, Mistress Ford!
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:
by your leave, good mistress.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Kisses her</stagedir><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
we shall drink down all unkindness.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS</stagedir><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
Songs and Sonnets here.
How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait
on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
about you, have you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIMPLE</persona><text>Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
afore Michaelmas?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with
you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
here. Do you understand me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,
I shall do that that is reason.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Nay, but understand me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>So I do, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray
you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his
country, simple though I stand here.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>But that is not the question: the question is
concerning your marriage.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Ay, there's the point, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
reasonable demands.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to
know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
good will to the maid?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
would do reason.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak
possitable, if you can carry her your desires
towards her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
request, cousin, in any reason.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do
is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
married and have more occasion to know one another;
I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:
but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that
I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in
the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our
meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Ay, I think my cousin meant well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANNE PAGE</persona><text>The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
worships' company.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SHALLOW</persona><text>I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt SHALLOW and SIR HUGH EVANS</stagedir><speech><persona>ANNE PAGE</persona><text>Will't please your worship to come in, sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANNE PAGE</persona><text>The dinner attends you, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my
cousin Shallow.
A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his
friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I
live like a poor gentleman born.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANNE PAGE</persona><text>I may not go in without your worship: they will not
sit till you come.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as
though I did.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANNE PAGE</persona><text>I pray you, sir, walk in.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot
abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANNE PAGE</persona><text>I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at
it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
the bear loose, are you not?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANNE PAGE</persona><text>Ay, indeed, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen
Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so
cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored
rough things.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Re-enter PAGE</stagedir><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Nay, pray you, lead the way.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>Come on, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANNE PAGE</persona><text>Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!

nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and
his wringer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIMPLE</persona><text>Well, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it
is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire

Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come.

</text></speech><speech><persona>PISTOL</persona><text>I ken the wight: he is of substance good.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PISTOL</persona><text>Two yards, and more.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
can construe the action of her familiar style; and
the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>PISTOL</persona><text>He hath studied her will, and translated her will,
out of honesty into English.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NYM</persona><text>The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PISTOL</persona><text>As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NYM</persona><text>The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
foot, sometimes my portly belly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PISTOL</persona><text>Then did the sun on dunghill shine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NYM</persona><text>I thank thee for that humour.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's
another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
be cheater to them both, and they shall be

What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
age to show himself a young gallant! What an

Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill

thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
different names--sure, more,--and these are of the

Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my

more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will
scarce obey this medicine.

Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the
water; and give him another hope, to betray him to
another punishment?

</text></speech><speech><persona>MISTRESS PAGE</persona><text>There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
The superstitious idle-headed eld
Received and did deliver to our age
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>Why, yet there want not many that do fear

That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
What shall be done with him? what is your plot?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MISTRESS PAGE</persona><text>That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
Nan Page my daughter and my little son
And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
With some diffused song: upon their sight,
We two in great amazedness will fly:
Then let them all encircle him about
And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
In shape profane.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MISTRESS FORD</persona><text>And till he tell the truth,
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
And burn him with their tapers.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MISTRESS PAGE</persona><text>The truth being known,
We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
And mock him home to Windsor.

Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.

The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
That neither singly can be manifested,
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
While other jests are something rank on foot,
Her father hath commanded her to slip
Away with Slender and with him at Eton
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
Her mother, ever strong against that match
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
While other sports are tasking of their minds,
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
She seemingly obedient likewise hath
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
Her father means she shall be all in white,
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
To take her by the hand and bid her go,
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
The better to denote her to the doctor,
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
The maid hath given consent to go with him.

And, in the lawful name of marrying,
To give our hearts united ceremony.

Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear
not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know
also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along

</text></speech><speech><persona>PISTOL</persona><text>Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:
Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,
There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:
Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:
I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.

That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,
Raise up the organs of her fantasy;
Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:
But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MISTRESS QUICKLY</persona><text>About, about;
Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:
Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:
That it may stand till the perpetual doom,
In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
The several chairs of order look you scour
With juice of balm and every precious flower:
Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;
Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,
Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:
Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
Our dance of custom round about the oak
Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set
And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
To guide our measure round about the tree.
But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.

If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

</text></speech><speech><persona>MISTRESS QUICKLY</persona><text>Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
Fie on sinful fantasy!
Fie on lust and luxury!
Lust is but a bloody fire,
Kindled with unchaste desire,
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
Pinch him for his villany;
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.

Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?

Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
Become the forest better than the town?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FORD</persona><text>Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his
horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his
cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be
paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for
it, Master Brook.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MISTRESS FORD</persona><text>Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.
I will never take you for my love again; but I will
always count you my deer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FORD</persona><text>Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>And these are not fairies? I was three or four
times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon
ill employment!
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your
desires, and fairies will not pinse you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FORD</persona><text>Well said, fairy Hugh.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FORD</persona><text>I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
able to woo her in good English.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that
it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
with a piece of toasted cheese.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR HUGH EVANS</persona><text>Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
through the realm.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MISTRESS PAGE</persona><text>Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FORD</persona><text>What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?

swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FALSTAFF</persona><text>Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I
am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use
me as you will.

Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to
whom you should have been a pander: over and above
that you have suffered, I think to repay that money
will be a biting affliction.

to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to
laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her

</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>Of what, son?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,
and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been
i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he
should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis
a postmaster's boy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took
a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for
all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had
him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how
you should know my daughter by her garments?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SLENDER</persona><text>I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she
cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet
it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.

turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is
now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.
