bear it for a difference between himself and his
horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.

And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart

And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
Then after to her father will I break;
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
In practise let us put it presently.

they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in

'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
Friendship is constant in all other things
Save in the office and affairs of love:
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
Let every eye negotiate for itself
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
This is an accident of hourly proof,
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!

duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to
the north star. I would not marry her, though she
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror

affection the one with the other. I would fain have
it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
you three will but minister such assistance as I
shall give you direction.

strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be
ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,

reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
offer them instances; which shall bear no less
likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night

will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth

I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
another man is a fool when he dedicates his
behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others, become the argument
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not
near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>CLAUDIO</persona><text>Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>CLAUDIO</persona><text>That.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>LEONATO</persona><text>O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
love him, I should.'
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>CLAUDIO</persona><text>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>LEONATO</persona><text>She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter

to herself: it is very true.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>DON PEDRO</persona><text>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
other, if she will not discover it.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>CLAUDIO</persona><text>To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
torment the poor lady worse.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>DON PEDRO</persona><text>An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an

cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>DON PEDRO</persona><text>I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would

will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere

accustomed crossness.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>DON PEDRO</persona><text>She doth well: if she should make tender of her

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>CLAUDIO</persona><text>And I take him to be valiant.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>DON PEDRO</persona><text>As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
them with a most Christian-like fear.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>The Song</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>LEONATO</persona><text>If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:

let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I

how much he is unworthy so good a lady.

must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
scene that I would see, which will be merely a
dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>BENEDICK</persona><text>  This can be no trick: the
conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
the love come from her; they say too that she will
rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
are they that hear their detractions and can put
them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
no great argument of her folly, for I will be
horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
because I have railed so long against marriage: but
doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
her.

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  LEONATO'S orchard.</sceneN><persona>BENEDICK</persona><text>Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.

There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>MARGARET</persona><text>I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.

As we do trace this alley up and down,
Our talk must only be of Benedick.
When I do name him, let it be thy part
To praise him more than ever man did merit:
My talk to thee must be how Benedick
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
That only wounds by hearsay.
Now begin;
For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>URSULA</persona><text>The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
I know her spirits are as coy and wild
As haggerds of the rock.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>URSULA</persona><text>But are you sure
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>URSULA</persona><text>And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
To wish him wrestle with affection,
And never to let Beatrice know of it.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>URSULA</persona><text>Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>O god of love! I know he doth deserve
As much as may be yielded to a man:
But Nature never framed a woman's heart
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
Misprising what they look on, and her wit
Values itself so highly that to her
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
She is so self-endeared.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>URSULA</persona><text>Sure, I think so;
And therefore certainly it were not good
She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
If low, an agate very vilely cut;
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
If silent, why, a block moved with none.
So turns she every man the wrong side out
And never gives to truth and virtue that
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>URSULA</persona><text>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
It were a better death than die with mocks,
Which is as bad as die with tickling.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>URSULA</persona><text>Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>No; rather I will go to Benedick
And counsel him to fight against his passion.
And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
How much an ill word may empoison liking.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>URSULA</persona><text>O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
She cannot be so much without true judgment--
Having so swift and excellent a wit
As she is prized to have--as to refuse
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>He is the only man of Italy.

For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
Goes foremost in report through Italy.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.

When are you married, madam?

I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>URSULA</persona><text>She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  LEONATO'S garden.</sceneN><persona>HERO</persona><text>If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.

What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
No glory lives behind the back of such.
And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
To bind our loves up in a holy band;
For others say thou dost deserve, and I
Believe it better than reportingly.

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>VERGES</persona><text>Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer

</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
they should have any allegiance in them, being
chosen for the prince's watch.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>VERGES</persona><text>Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>First, who think you the most desertless man to be
constable?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>First Watchman</persona><text>Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can
write and read.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>Second Watchman</persona><text>Both which, master constable,--
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
let that appear when there is no need of such
vanity. You are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>Second Watchman</persona><text>How if a' will not stand?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
presently call the rest of the watch together and
thank God you are rid of a knave.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>VERGES</persona><text>If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
of the prince's subjects.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>True, and they are to meddle with none but the
prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>Watchman</persona><text>We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
belongs to a watch.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>Watchman</persona><text>How if they will not?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
they make you not then the better answer, you may
say they are not the men you took them for.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>Watchman</persona><text>Well, sir.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
why the more is for your honesty.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>Watchman</persona><text>If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
hands on him?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>VERGES</persona><text>You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
a man who hath any honesty in him.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>VERGES</persona><text>If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
to the nurse and bid her still it.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>Watchman</persona><text>How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>VERGES</persona><text>'Tis very true.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>DOGBERRY</persona><text>This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
prince in the night, you may stay him.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>VERGES</persona><text>Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.

the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>VERGES</persona><text>By'r lady, I think it be so.

Come, neighbour.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>Watchman</persona><text>Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here

price they will.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>CONRADE</persona><text>I wonder at it.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>BORACHIO</persona><text>That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that

nothing to a man.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>CONRADE</persona><text>Yes, it is apparel.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>BORACHIO</persona><text>I mean, the fashion.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>CONRADE</persona><text>Yes, the fashion is the fashion.

fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot

sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>CONRADE</persona><text>All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
out more apparel than the man. But art not thou

shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>BORACHIO</persona><text>Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE III.  A street.</sceneN><persona>CONRADE</persona><text>And thought they Margaret was Hero?

devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
at the temple, and there, before the whole
congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
and send her home again without a husband.

now is he become a man: he swore he would never
marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
his meat without grudging: and how you may be
converted I know not, but methinks you look with
your eyes as other women do.

Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
Comes not that blood as modest evidence

All you that see her, that she were a maid,
By these exterior shows? But she is none:
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,

Silent so long and given way unto
This course of fortune
By noting of the lady. I have mark'd
A thousand blushing apparitions
To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
To burn the errors that these princes hold
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
Trust not my reading nor my observations,
Which with experimental seal doth warrant
The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
Under some biting error.

Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
Is that she will not add to her damnation
A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
That which appears in proper nakedness?

Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
Prove you that any man with me conversed
At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!

These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
Nor age so eat up my invention,
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
Ability in means and choice of friends,
To quit me of them throughly.

And let my counsel sway you in this case.
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
And publish it that she is dead indeed;
Maintain a mourning ostentation
And on your family's old monument
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
That appertain unto a burial.
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  A church.</sceneN><persona>LEONATO</persona><text>What shall become of this? what will this do?
</text></speech><speech><stagedir>Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO</stagedir><sceneN>SCENE I.  A church.</sceneN><persona>FRIAR FRANCIS</persona><text>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
But not for that dream I on this strange course,
But on this travail look for greater birth.
She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
Upon the instant that she was accused,
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
Of every hearer: for it so falls out
That what we have we prize not to the worth
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
Why, then we rack the value, then we find
The virtue that possession would not show us
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
When he shall hear she died upon his words,
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
Into his study of imagination,
And every lovely organ of her life
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
More moving-delicate and full of life,
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
If ever love had interest in his liver,
And wish he had not so accused her,
No, though he thought his accusation true.
Let this be so, and doubt not but success
Will fashion the event in better shape
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
The supposition of the lady's death
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
As best befits her wounded reputation,
In some reclusive and religious life,
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.

Against yourself.

Which falls into mine ears as profitless
As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
Bring me a father that so loved his child,
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
And bid him speak of patience;
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
And let it answer every strain for strain,
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
And I of him will gather patience.
But there is no such man: for, brother, men
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
Their counsel turns to passion, which before
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
Charm ache with air and agony with words:
No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
To be so moral when he shall endure
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

The god of love,
That sits above,
And knows me, and knows me,
How pitiful I deserve,--
I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?

Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,

Lives in death with glorious fame.

Praising her when I am dumb.
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
Pardon, goddess of the night,
Those that slew thy virgin knight;
For the which, with songs of woe,
Round about her tomb they go.

Till death be uttered,
Heavily, heavily.

wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:
if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
purpose that the world can say against it; and
therefore never flout at me for what I have said
against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.
