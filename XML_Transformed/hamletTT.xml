</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along

He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERNARDO</persona><text>Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole

</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERNARDO</persona><text>It would be spoke to.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>Question it, Horatio.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!

</text></speech><speech><persona>BERNARDO</persona><text>How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>Is it not like the king?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERNARDO</persona><text>I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Do, if it will not stand.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERNARDO</persona><text>'Tis here!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>'Tis here!
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>'Tis gone!
We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERNARDO</persona><text>It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
</text></speech></speeches></scene><scene><title>SCENE II.  A room of state in the castle.</title><speeches><stagedir>Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
and Attendants</stagedir><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORNELIUS</persona><text>In that and all things will we show our duty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Ay, madam, it is common.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt all but HAMLET</stagedir><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
My father's brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I am glad to see you well:
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>My good lord--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>A truant disposition, good my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father!--methinks I see my father.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Where, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>In my mind's eye, Horatio.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Saw? who?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>My lord, the king your father.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>The king my father!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Season your admiration for awhile
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>For God's love, let me hear.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>But where was this?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Did you not speak to it?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from our sight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>'Tis very strange.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>We do, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Arm'd, say you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>Arm'd, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>From top to toe?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>My lord, from head to foot.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Then saw you not his face?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>What, look'd he frowningly?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Pale or red?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Nay, very pale.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>And fix'd his eyes upon you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Most constantly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I would I had been there.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>It would have much amazed you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARCELLUS</persona><text>Longer, longer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Not when I saw't.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>His beard was grizzled--no?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I will watch to-night;

And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OPHELIA</persona><text>Do you doubt that?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OPHELIA</persona><text>No more but so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Think it no more;
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OPHELIA</persona><text>I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>O, fear me not.
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
A double blessing is a double grace,
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;

</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Is it a custom?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Ay, marry, is't:
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo--
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.

Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>O God!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Ghost</persona><text>Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Murder!

But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
May sweep to my revenge.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Ghost</persona><text>I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Ghost</persona><text>Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
And prey on garbage.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head:
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it:

As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,

Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>REYNALDO</persona><text>As gaming, my lord.

</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency;
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.

</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Marry, sir, here's my drift;
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence;
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country.
</text></speech><speech><persona>REYNALDO</persona><text>Very good, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
something: where did I leave?
</text></speech><speech><persona>REYNALDO</persona><text>At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
and 'gentleman.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions out:

Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Mad for thy love?

Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
And, to the last, bended their light on me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings

That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
</text></speech><speech><persona>OPHELIA</persona><text>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
I did repel his fetters and denied
His access to me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
This must be known; which, being kept close, might
move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
That so his sickness, age and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polack:
With an entreaty, herein further shown,

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>It likes us well;
And at our more consider'd time well read,
Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
Most welcome home!
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Well be with you, gentlemen!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
out of his swaddling-clouts.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
say an old man is twice a child.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
'twas so indeed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>My lord, I have news to tell you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>My lord, I have news to tell you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>The actors are come hither, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Buz, buz!
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Upon mine honour,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Then came each actor on his ass,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
liberty, these are the only men.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>What a treasure had he, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Why,
'One fair daughter and no more,
The which he loved passing well.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>  Still on my daughter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
that I love passing well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Nay, that follows not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>What follows, then, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Why,
'As by lot, God wot,'
and then, you know,
'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Player</persona><text>What speech, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
digested in the scenes, set down with as much
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation; but called it an
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
at this line: let me see, let me see--
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
So, proceed you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
good discretion.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Player</persona><text>'Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
Did nothing.
But, as we often see, against some storm,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
In general synod 'take away her power;
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
As low as to the fiends!'
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>This is too long.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Player</persona><text>'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>'The mobled queen?'
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Player</persona><text>'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
pronounced:
But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
The instant burst of clamour that she made,
Unless things mortal move them not at all,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
And passion in the gods.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
Good my lord, will you see the players well
bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
time: after your death you were better have a bad
epitaph than their ill report while you live.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Take them in.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Come, sirs.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
Murder of Gonzago?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Player</persona><text>Ay, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Player</persona><text>Ay, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
not.
My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
welcome to Elsinore.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>Good my lord!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
Now I am alone.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Ha!
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
More relative than this: the play 's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS</stagedir><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>This business is well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>More matter, with less art.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause:
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
beautified Ophelia,'--
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
'In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>Came this from Hamlet to her?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
As they fell out by time, by means and place,
All given to mine ear.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>But how hath she
Received his love?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>What do you think of me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>As of a man faithful and honourable.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Do you think 'tis this?
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>It may be, very likely.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
When it proved otherwise?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Not that I know.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
If circumstances lead me, I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the centre.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>How may we try it further?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>So he does indeed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Mark the encounter: if he love her not
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
But keep a farm and carters.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>We will try it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Away, I do beseech you, both away:
I'll board him presently.
O, give me leave:
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Well, God-a-mercy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Do you know me, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Not I, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Then I would you were so honest a man.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Honest, my lord!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>That's very true, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>I have, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to 't.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>  How say you by that? Still harping on my
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
What do you read, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Words, words, words.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>What is the matter, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Between who?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
you could go backward.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>  Though this be madness, yet there is method
in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Into my grave.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LORD POLONIUS</persona><text>Indeed, that is out o' the air.
How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
more willingly part withal: except my life, except
my life, except my life.

</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>As the indifferent children of the earth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GUILDENSTERN</persona><text>Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Nor the soles of her shoe?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>Neither, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of

</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
that she sends you to prison hither?
</text></speech><speech><persona>GUILDENSTERN</persona><text>Prison, my lord!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Denmark's a prison.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>Then is the world one.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>We think not so, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
it is a prison.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
narrow for your mind.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
have bad dreams.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GUILDENSTERN</persona><text>Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>A dream itself is but a shadow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>We'll wait upon you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GUILDENSTERN</persona><text>What should we say, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>To what end, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>  What say you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
love me, hold not off.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GUILDENSTERN</persona><text>My lord, we were sent for.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
you seem to say so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSENCRANTZ</persona><text>My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?

call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.

they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no

exclaim against their own succession?

</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter HAMLET</stagedir><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>To be, or not to be: that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>No, not I;
I never gave you aught.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OPHELIA</persona><text>My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;

Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.

</text></speech><speech><persona>OPHELIA</persona><text>Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
with honesty?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
time gives it proof. I did love you once.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OPHELIA</persona><text>Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot

my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,

for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it

periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who

from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,

censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition

And could of men distinguish, her election

A man that fortune's buffets and rewards

Do not itself unkennel in one speech,

But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:

Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose

And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope.
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>O Hamlet, speak no more:
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.

In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>O, speak to me no more;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,

And put it in his pocket!
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>No more!

That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Ghost</persona><text>Do not forget: this visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Speak to her, Hamlet.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>How is it with you, lady?
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects: then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.

There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,

The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures

Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot

Of my true mother.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>What is the cause, Laertes,
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,

Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,

To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!

Most thoroughly for my father.

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Good Laertes,
If you desire to know the certainty
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
Winner and loser?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>None but his enemies.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Will you know them then?

Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
Should be as moral as an old man's life?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.

O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false

some violets, but they withered all when my father
died: they say he made a good end,--

And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead:
Go to thy death-bed:
He never will come again.
His beard was as white as snow,
All flaxen was his poll:
He is gone, he is gone,
And we cast away moan:
God ha' mercy on his soul!
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
this, give these fellows some means to the king:
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course for England: of them I have much to tell
thee. Farewell.
'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them.
</text></speech></speeches></scene><scene><title>SCENE VII.  Another room in the castle.</title><speeches><stagedir>Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES</stagedir><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>It well appears: but tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
You mainly were stirr'd up.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>O, for two special reasons;
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not but by her. The other motive,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
And not where I had aim'd them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>And so have I a noble father lost;
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
How now! what news?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Messenger</persona><text>Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
This to your majesty; this to the queen.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>From Hamlet! who brought them?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Messenger</persona><text>Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
They were given me by Claudio; he received them
Of him that brought them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Know you the hand?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
Can you advise me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
'Thus didest thou.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>If it be so, Laertes--
As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
Will you be ruled by me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Ay, my lord;
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
No more to undertake it, I will work him
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
And call it accident.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>My lord, I will be ruled;
The rather, if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
Of the unworthiest siege.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>What part is that, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>A very riband in the cap of youth,
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
The light and careless livery that it wears
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
Come short of what he did.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>A Norman was't?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>A Norman.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Upon my life, Lamond.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>The very same.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>He made confession of you,
And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especially,
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
Now, out of this,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>What out of this, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Why ask you this?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Not that I think you did not love your father;
But that I know love is begun by time;
And that I see, in passages of proof,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
Dies in his own too much: that we would do
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
To show yourself your father's son in deed
More than in words?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>To cut his throat i' the church.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
Most generous and free from all contriving,
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
Requite him for your father.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>I will do't:
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
It may be death.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Let's further think of this;
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
Should have a back or second, that might hold,
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
When in your motion you are hot and dry--
As make your bouts more violent to that end--
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
Our purpose may hold there.
How now, sweet queen!
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>One woe doth tread upon another's heel,

</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Drown'd! O, where?
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or like a creature native and indued
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Alas, then, she is drown'd?
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>Drown'd, drown'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet

Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
But that this folly douts it.

Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the

gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
grave-maker?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Clown</persona><text>Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.

is mad, and sent into England.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Clown</persona><text>Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Why?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Clown</persona><text>'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men

</text></speech><speech><persona>First Clown</persona><text>I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year

</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Why he more than another?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Clown</persona><text>Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
he will keep out water a great while; and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Whose was it?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Clown</persona><text>A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Nay, I know not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Clown</persona><text>A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a

Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow

borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how

it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your

</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.

That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,

When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,

</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again; making so bold,
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
My head should be struck off.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Ay, good my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>An earnest conjuration from the king,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Without debatement further, more or less,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving-time allow'd.

I had my father's signet in my purse,
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Thou know'st already.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Why, man, they did make love to this employment;

Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,

But I am very sorry, good Horatio,

Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
differences, of very soft society and great showing:
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
him, his umbrage, nothing more.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath?

</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
You will do't, sir, really.

</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>Of Laertes?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Of him, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>I know you are not ignorant--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
know himself.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>What's his weapon?
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>Rapier and dagger.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>That's two of his weapons: but, well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>What call you the carriages?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
against six French swords, their assigns, and three
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>How if I answer 'no'?
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>I commend my duty to your lordship.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Yours, yours.
He does well to commend it himself; there are no

</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
yesty collection, which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.

Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Lord</persona><text>The king and queen and all are coming down.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>In happy time.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Lord</persona><text>The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>She well instructs me.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I do not think so: since he went into France, I
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
about my heart: but it is no matter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Nay, good my lord,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
fit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?

Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &amp;c</stagedir><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's</stagedir><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
With sore distraction. What I have done,
That might your nature, honour and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Sir, in this audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
And hurt my brother.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
And will not wrong it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I embrace it freely;
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Come, one for me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
Stick fiery off indeed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>You mock me, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>No, by this hand.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
You know the wager?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Very well, my lord
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>This is too heavy, let me see another.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>They prepare to play</stagedir><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>Ay, my good lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Come on, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Come, my lord.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>They play</stagedir><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>One.

</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>A hit, a very palpable hit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Well; again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Here's to thy health.
Give him the cup.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
Another hit; what say you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>A touch, a touch, I do confess.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Our son shall win.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Good madam!
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>Gertrude, do not drink.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>Come, let me wipe thy face.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>My lord, I'll hit him now.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>I do not think't.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Say you so? come on.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>Nothing, neither way.

</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>How does the queen?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>She swounds to see them bleed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN GERTRUDE</persona><text>No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Dies</stagedir><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
Treachery! Seek it out.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>The point!--envenom'd too!
Then, venom, to thy work.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Never believe it:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
Here's yet some liquor left.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>As thou'rt a man,
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story.
What warlike noise is this?
</text></speech><speech><persona>OSRIC</persona><text>Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>O, I die, Horatio;
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING CLAUDIUS</persona><text>O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HAMLET</persona><text>Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Follow my mother.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>KING CLAUDIUS dies</stagedir><speech><persona>LAERTES</persona><text>He is justly served;
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Nor thine on me.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,
and others</stagedir><speech><persona>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</persona><text>Where is this sight?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</persona><text>This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Ambassador</persona><text>The sight is dismal;
And our affairs from England come too late:
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
Where should we have our thanks?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Not from his mouth,
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view;
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about: so shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
Truly deliver.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</persona><text>Let us haste to hear it,
And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HORATIO</persona><text>Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
On plots and errors, happen.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE FORTINBRAS</persona><text>Let four captains
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
