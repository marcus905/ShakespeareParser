Athens. A hall in Timon's house.</title><speeches><stagedir>Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and
others, at several doors</stagedir><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Good day, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>I am glad you're well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>I have not seen you long: how goes the world?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>It wears, sir, as it grows.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Ay, that's well known:
But what particular rarity? what strange,
Which manifold record not matches? See,
Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Merchant</persona><text>O, 'tis a worthy lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Jeweller</persona><text>Nay, that's most fix'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Merchant</persona><text>A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
To an untirable and continuate goodness:
He passes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Jeweller:</persona><text>I have a jewel here--
</text></speech><speech><persona>Merchant</persona><text>O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Jeweller:</persona><text>If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>  'When we for recompense have
praised the vile,
It stains the glory in that happy verse
Which aptly sings the good.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>Merchant</persona><text>'Tis a good form.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Looking at the jewel</stagedir><speech><persona>Jeweller</persona><text>And rich: here is a water, look ye.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
To the great lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>A thing slipp'd idly from me.
Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
Provokes itself and like the current flies
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
Let's see your piece.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>'Tis a good piece.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>Indifferent.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Admirable: how this grace
Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
One might interpret.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>It is a pretty mocking of the life.
Here is a touch; is't good?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>I will say of it,
It tutors nature: artificial strife
Lives in these touches, livelier than life.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter certain Senators, and pass over</stagedir><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>How this lord is follow'd!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>The senators of Athens: happy man!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>Look, more!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>You see this confluence, this great flood
of visitors.
I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
With amplest entertainment: my free drift
Halts not particularly, but moves itself
In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
Infects one comma in the course I hold;
But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
Leaving no tract behind.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>How shall I understand you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>I will unbolt to you.
You see how all conditions, how all minds,
As well of glib and slippery creatures as
Of grave and austere quality, tender down
Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
To Apemantus, that few things loves better
Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
The knee before him, and returns in peace
Most rich in Timon's nod.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>I saw them speak together.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
That labour on the bosom of this sphere
To propagate their states: amongst them all,
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,
One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
Translates his rivals.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>'Tis conceived to scope.
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
In our condition.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Nay, sir, but hear me on.
All those which were his fellows but of late,
Some better than his value, on the moment
Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
Drink the free air.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>Ay, marry, what of these?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants
Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
Not one accompanying his declining foot.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>'Tis common:
A thousand moral paintings I can show
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
The foot above the head.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself
courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from
VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other
servants following</stagedir><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Imprison'd is he, say you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Messenger</persona><text>Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
His means most short, his creditors most strait:
Your honourable letter he desires
To those have shut him up; which failing,
Periods his comfort.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Noble Ventidius! Well;
I am not of that feather to shake off
My friend when he must need me. I do know him
A gentleman that well deserves a help:
Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,
and free him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Messenger</persona><text>Your lordship ever binds him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
But to support him after. Fare you well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Messenger</persona><text>All happiness to your honour!
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter an old Athenian</stagedir><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>Lord Timon, hear me speak.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Freely, good father.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>I have so: what of him?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>Here, at your lordship's service.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
By night frequents my house. I am a man
That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
And my estate deserves an heir more raised
Than one which holds a trencher.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Well; what further?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>One only daughter have I, no kin else,
On whom I may confer what I have got:
The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
And I have bred her at my dearest cost
In qualities of the best. This man of thine
Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
Join with me to forbid him her resort;
Myself have spoke in vain.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>The man is honest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>Therefore he will be, Timon:
His honesty rewards him in itself;
It must not bear my daughter.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Does she love him?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>She is young and apt:
Our own precedent passions do instruct us
What levity's in youth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>           Love you the maid?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>If in her marriage my consent be missing,
I call the gods to witness, I will choose
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
And dispossess her all.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>How shall she be endow'd,
if she be mated with an equal husband?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>Three talents on the present; in future, all.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
To build his fortune I will strain a little,
For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
And make him weigh with her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Old Athenian</persona><text>Most noble lord,
Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
The state or fortune fall into my keeping,
Which is not owed to you!
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian</stagedir><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
Go not away. What have you there, my friend?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>A piece of painting, which I do beseech
Your lordship to accept.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Painting is welcome.
The painting is almost the natural man;
or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
Even such as they give out. I like your work;
And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
Till you hear further from me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>The gods preserve ye!
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;
We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
Hath suffer'd under praise.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Jeweller</persona><text>What, my lord! dispraise?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>A more satiety of commendations.
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
It would unclew me quite.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Jeweller</persona><text>My lord, 'tis rated
As those which sell would give: but you well know,
Things of like value differing in the owners
Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Well mock'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Merchant</persona><text>No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
Which all men speak with him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Look, who comes here: will you be chid?
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter APEMANTUS</stagedir><speech><persona>Jeweller</persona><text>We'll bear, with your lordship.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Merchant</persona><text>He'll spare none.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Are they not Athenians?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Yes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Then I repent not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Jeweller</persona><text>You know me, Apemantus?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Thou art proud, Apemantus.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Whither art going?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>That's a deed thou'lt die for.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>The best, for the innocence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Wrought he not well that painted it?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>He wrought better that made the painter; and yet
he's but a filthy piece of work.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Painter</persona><text>You're a dog.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>No; I eat not lords.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>That's a lascivious apprehension.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a
man a doit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>What dost thou think 'tis worth?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>How now, philosopher!
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Thou liest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Art not one?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Yes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Then I lie not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Art not a poet?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>Yes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou
hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Poet</persona><text>That's not feigned; he is so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>What, thyself?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Ay.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Wherefore?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
Art not thou a merchant?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Merchant</persona><text>Ay, Apemantus.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Merchant</persona><text>If traffic do it, the gods do it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger</stagedir><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>What trumpet's that?

All of companionship.

You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
Most welcome, sir!
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>So, so, there!
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
That there should be small love 'mongst these
sweet knaves,
And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
Into baboon and monkey.

Most hungerly on your sight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Right welcome, sir!
Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time
In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.

</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>Fare thee well, fare thee well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>Why, Apemantus?

And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
The very heart of kindness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,
But breeds the giver a return exceeding
All use of quittance.

It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,
And call him to long peace.
He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
To your free heart, I do return those talents,
Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
I derived liberty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>O, by no means,
Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:
I gave it freely ever; and there's none
Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.
</text></speech><speech><persona>VENTIDIUS</persona><text>A noble spirit!
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Nay, my lords,
Ceremony was but devised at first
To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
Than my fortunes to me.

</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>O, Apemantus, you are welcome.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>No;
You shall not make me welcome:
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there
Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond
man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by
himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
he fit for't, indeed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to
observe; I give thee warning on't.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,
therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;
prithee, let my meat make thee silent.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me
to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;
and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
Methinks they should invite them without knives;
Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
There's much example for't; the fellow that sits
next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>Let it flow this way, my good lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>APEMANTUS</persona><text>Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides
well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to
be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
Apemantus' grace.
Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
I pray for no man but myself:
Grant I may never prove so fond,
To trust man on his oath or bond;
Or a harlot, for her weeping;
Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:
Or a keeper with my freedom;
Or my friends, if I should need 'em.

</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
themselves have provided that I shall have much help
from you: how had you been my friends else? why
have you that charitable title from thousands, did
not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty
speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they
were the most needless creatures living, should we
ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
are born to do benefits: and what better or
properer can we can our own than the riches of our
friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have
so many, like brothers, commanding one another's
fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
forget their faults, I drink to you.

Being of no power to make his wishes good:

For every word: he is so kind that he now
Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.

When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;
Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
To hold your hand more close: I did endure
Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--
The greatest of your having lacks a half
To pay your present debts.

How quickly were it gone!
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>You tell me true.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FLAVIUS</persona><text>If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
Call me before the exactest auditors
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
When all our offices have been oppress'd
With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
And set mine eyes at flow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Prithee, no more.

Lord Timon's?
Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!
Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,
These flies are couch'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TIMON</persona><text>Come, sermon me no further:
No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,
To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
If I would broach the vessels of my love,
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
As I can bid thee speak.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FLAVIUS</persona><text>Assurance bless your thoughts!

Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity;--
And so, intending other serious matters,
After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,
With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
They froze me into silence.

Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.
Go to Ventidius.
Prithee, be not sad,
Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.
No blame belongs to thee.
Ventidius lately
Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd
Into a great estate: when he was poor,
Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,
I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;
Bid him suppose some good necessity
Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd
With those five talents.
That had, give't these fellows
To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.

Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a
bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou
knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,
that this is no time to lend money, especially upon

</text></speech><speech><persona>First Stranger</persona><text>We know him for no less, though we are but strangers
to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
happy hours are done and past, and his estate
shrinks from him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Stranger</persona><text>But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,
one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and
showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>How!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Stranger</persona><text>I tell you, denied, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,
I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!
there was very little honour showed in't. For my own
part, I must needs confess, I have received some
small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels
and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;
yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should
ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.

</text></speech><speech><persona>SERVILIUS</persona><text>May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to
that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank
him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SERVILIUS</persona><text>Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
with so many talents.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>I know his lordship is but merry with me;
He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SERVILIUS</persona><text>But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
If his occasion were not virtuous,
I should not urge it half so faithfully.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SERVILIUS</persona><text>Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself
against such a good time, when I might ha' shown
myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I
should purchase the day before for a little part,
and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,
before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more
beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon
myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would
not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.
Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I
hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,
because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
this from me, I count it one of my greatest
afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you
befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SERVILIUS</persona><text>Yes, sir, I shall.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.

Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
And does he send to me? Three? hum!
It shows but little love or judgment in him:
Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
physicians,
Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,
That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,
But his occasion might have woo'd me first;
For, in my conscience, I was the first man
That e'er received gift from him:
And does he think so backwardly of me now,
That I'll requite its last? No:
So it may prove an argument of laughter
To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.
I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
And with their faint reply this answer join;
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.

</text></speech><speech><persona>ALCIBIADES</persona><text>I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
For pity is the virtue of the law,
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.
He is a man, setting his fate aside,
Of comely virtues:
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
An honour in him which buys out his fault--
But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
He did oppose his foe:
And with such sober and unnoted passion
He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
As if he had but proved an argument.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Senator</persona><text>You undergo too strict a paradox,
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
Upon the head of valour; which indeed
Is valour misbegot and came into the world
When sects and factions were newly born:
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,
carelessly,
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
To bring it into danger.
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!

If I speak like a captain.
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
Without repugnancy? If there be
Such valour in the bearing, what make we
Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,
As you are great, be pitifully good:
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
To be in anger is impiety;
But who is man that is not angry?
Weigh but the crime with this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Senator</persona><text>You breathe in vain.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ALCIBIADES</persona><text>In vain! his service done

Were a sufficient briber for his life.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Senator</persona><text>What's that?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ALCIBIADES</persona><text>I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
And slain in fight many of your enemies:
How full of valour did he bear himself
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Senator</persona><text>He has made too much plenty with 'em;
He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:
If there were no foes, that were enough
To overcome him: in that beastly fury
He has been known to commit outrages,
And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

My lords, if not for any parts in him--
Though his right arm might purchase his own time
And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,
Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:
And, for I know your reverend ages love
Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
My honours to you, upon his good returns.
If by this crime he owes the law his life,
Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.

rest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,
together with the common lag of people--what is

That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,
And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!
Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
And minister in their steads! to general filths
Convert o' the instant, green virginity,
Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;
Rather than render back, out with your knives,
And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,
With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
Decline to your confounding contraries,
And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,
Your potent and infectious fevers heap
On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop
Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
at their society, as their friendship, may
merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,
But nakedness, thou detestable town!
Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--
The Athenians both within and out that wall!
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.

The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,
As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;
Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:
Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
Since riches point to misery and contempt?
Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
But in a dream of friendship?
To have his pomp and all what state compounds
But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!
Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?
For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to
Supply his life, or that which can command it.
I'll follow and inquire him out:
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;
Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.

Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,
Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,
But by contempt of nature.
Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
The beggar native honour.
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
In purity of manhood stand upright,
And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,
So are they all; for every grise of fortune
Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:
Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
With thy most operant poison! What is here?
Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,
I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
This yellow slave
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
And give them title, knee and approbation
With senators on the bench: this is it
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds
Among the route of nations, I will make thee
Do thy right nature.
Ha! a drum? Thou'rt quick,

When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.

I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
The want whereof doth daily make revolt

How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--

Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;

It is her habit only that is honest,
Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,
That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:
Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.

And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs

Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
His antidotes are poison, and he slays
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
Break open shops; nothing can you steal,
But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.

The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring
Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:
Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.

Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?
Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.
Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
Our captain hath in every figure skill,
An aged interpreter, though young in days:
Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.

Our terrible approach.
Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
With all licentious measure, making your wills
The scope of justice; till now myself and such
As slept within the shadow of your power
Have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
And pursy insolence shall break his wind
With fear and horrid flight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Senator</persona><text>Noble and young,
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
Above their quantity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Senator</persona><text>So did we woo
Transformed Timon to our city's love
By humble message and by promised means:
We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
The common stroke of war.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Senator</persona><text>These walls of ours
Were not erected by their hands from whom
You have received your griefs; nor are they such
That these great towers, trophies and schools
should fall
For private faults in them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Senator</persona><text>Nor are they living
Who were the motives that you first went out;
Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess
Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
Into our city with thy banners spread:
By decimation, and a tithed death--
If thy revenges hunger for that food
Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,
And by the hazard of the spotted die
Let die the spotted.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Senator</persona><text>All have not offended;
For those that were, it is not square to take
On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,
But kill not all together.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Senator</persona><text>What thou wilt,
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
Than hew to't with thy sword.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Senator </persona><text>Set but thy foot
Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
To say thou'lt enter friendly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Senator</persona><text>Throw thy glove,
Or any token of thine honour else,
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
And not as our confusion, all thy powers
Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
Have seal'd thy full desire.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ALCIBIADES</persona><text>Then there's my glove;
Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears
With my more noble meaning, not a man
Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
But shall be render'd to your public laws
At heaviest answer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Both</persona><text>'Tis most nobly spoken.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ALCIBIADES</persona><text>Descend, and keep your words.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter Soldier</stagedir><speech><persona>Soldier</persona><text>My noble general, Timon is dead;
Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;
And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
Interprets for my poor ignorance.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ALCIBIADES</persona><text>  'Here lies a
wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
caitiffs left!
Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:
Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay
not here thy gait.'
These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
droplets which
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
Is noble Timon: of whose memory
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
And I will use the olive with my sword,
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
Let our drums strike.
