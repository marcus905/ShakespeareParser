Attendants</stagedir><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame or a dowager
Long withering out a young man revenue.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HIPPOLYTA</persona><text>Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
And then the moon, like to a silver bow
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
Of our solemnities.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>Go, Philostrate,
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS</stagedir><speech><persona>EGEUS</persona><text>Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
</text></speech><speech><persona>EGEUS</persona><text>Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
And stolen the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
Be it so she; will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
To you your father should be as a god;
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
To whom you are but as a form in wax
By him imprinted and within his power
To leave the figure or disfigure it.
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>So is Lysander.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>In himself he is;
But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
The other must be held the worthier.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
I know not by what power I am made bold,
Nor how it may concern my modesty,
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
But I beseech your grace that I may know
The worst that may befall me in this case,
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>Either to die the death or to abjure
For ever the society of men.
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
You can endure the livery of a nun,
For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
To live a barren sister all your life,
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
Ere I will my virgin patent up
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
For everlasting bond of fellowship--
Upon that day either prepare to die
For disobedience to your father's will,
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
Or on Diana's altar to protest
For aye austerity and single life.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DEMETRIUS</persona><text>Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
Thy crazed title to my certain right.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>You have her father's love, Demetrius;
Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EGEUS</persona><text>Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
And what is mine my love shall render him.
And she is mine, and all my right of her
I do estate unto Demetrius.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
Why should not I then prosecute my right?
Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>I must confess that I have heard so much,
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
But, being over-full of self-affairs,
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
I have some private schooling for you both.
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
To fit your fancies to your father's will;
Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
Which by no means we may extenuate--
To death, or to a vow of single life.
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
I must employ you in some business
Against our nuptial and confer with you
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EGEUS</persona><text>With duty and desire we follow you.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA</stagedir><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>Belike for want of rain, which I could well
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,
The course of true love never did run smooth;
But, either it was different in blood,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Making it momentany as a sound,
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
So quick bright things come to confusion.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
It stands as an edict in destiny:
Then let us teach our trial patience,
Because it is a customary cross,
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
I have a widow aunt, a dowager
Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
And she respects me as her only son.
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
And to that place the sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
And in the wood, a league without the town,
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
To do observance to a morn of May,
There will I stay for thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>My good Lysander!
I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
By his best arrow with the golden head,
By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
By all the vows that ever men have broke,
In number more than ever women spoke,
In that same place thou hast appointed me,
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter HELENA</stagedir><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>God speed fair Helena! whither away?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
O, teach me how you look, and with what art
You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>O that my prayers could such affection move!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>The more I hate, the more he follows me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>The more I love, the more he hateth me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
Lysander and myself will fly this place.
Before the time I did Lysander see,
Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage in the watery glass,
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>And in the wood, where often you and I
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
To seek new friends and stranger companies.
Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>I will, my Hermia.
Helena, adieu:
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>How happy some o'er other some can be!
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
He will not know what all but he do know:
And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
So I, admiring of his qualities:
Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
Love can transpose to form and dignity:
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
And therefore is Love said to be a child,
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
So the boy Love is perjured every where:
For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
Pursue her; and for this intelligence
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
To have his sight thither and back again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DEMETRIUS</persona><text>No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
without warning.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HIPPOLYTA</persona><text>This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
are no worse, if imagination amend them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HIPPOLYTA</persona><text>It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>If we imagine no worse of them than they of
themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.

</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>You were best to call them generally, man by man,
according to the scrip.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
wedding-day at night.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
to a point.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>That will ask some tears in the true performing of
it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
tear a cat in, to make all split.
The raging rocks
And shivering shocks
Shall break the locks
Of prison gates;
And Phibbus' car
Shall shine from far
And make and mar
The foolish Fates.
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
more condoling.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FLUTE</persona><text>Here, Peter Quince.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FLUTE</persona><text>What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FLUTE</persona><text>Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
you may speak as small as you will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
and lady dear!'
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>Well, proceed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>Robin Starveling, the tailor.
</text></speech><speech><persona>STARVELING</persona><text>Here, Peter Quince.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
Tom Snout, the tinker.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SNOUT</persona><text>Here, Peter Quince.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
hope, here is a play fitted.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SNUG</persona><text>Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
let him roar again.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
and that were enough to hang us all.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ALL</persona><text>That would hang us, every mother's son.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
nightingale.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
to play it in?
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>Why, what you will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
perfect yellow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUINCE</persona><text>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
wants. I pray you, fail me not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOTTOM</persona><text>We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.

Thorough bush, thorough brier,
Over park, over pale,
Thorough flood, thorough fire,

Swifter than the moon's sphere;
And I serve the fairy queen,
To dew her orbs upon the green.
The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
In their gold coats spots you see;
Those be rubies, fairy favours,
In those freckles live their savours:
I must go seek some dewdrops here
And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.

Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
Because that she as her attendant hath
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
She never had so sweet a changeling;
And jealous Oberon would have the child
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
And now they never meet in grove or green,
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.

Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
Are not you he?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PUCK</persona><text>Thou speak'st aright;

I jest to Oberon and make him smile

Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
In very likeness of a roasted crab,
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there.

Contagious fogs; which falling in the land

That they have overborne their continents:
The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
The human mortals want their winter here;
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
That rheumatic diseases do abound:
And thorough this distemperature we see
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
The childing autumn, angry winter, change
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
By their increase, now knows not which is which:
And this same progeny of evils comes
From our debate, from our dissension;
We are their parents and original.

The fairy land buys not the child of me.
His mother was a votaress of my order:
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
To fetch me trifles, and return again,
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
And for her sake I will not part with him.

My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
Since once I sat upon a promontory,
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
That the rude sea grew civil at her song
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
To hear the sea-maid's music.

Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
At a fair vestal throned by the west,
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
And the imperial votaress passed on,
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
It fell upon a little western flower,
Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
Will make or man or woman madly dote
Upon the next live creature that it sees.

Near to her close and consecrated bower,
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
Were met together to rehearse a play
Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
When I did him at this advantage take,
An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
thus strong,
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
things catch.
I led them on in this distracted fear,
And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
When in that moment, so it came to pass,
Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>What love could press Lysander from my side?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
To bait me with this foul derision?
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
When we have chid the hasty-footed time
For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
Have with our needles created both one flower,
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
But yet an union in partition;
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
Though I alone do feel the injury.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>I am amazed at your passionate words.
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
And made your other love, Demetrius,
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
And tender me, forsooth, affection,
But by your setting on, by your consent?
What thought I be not so in grace as you,
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
But miserable most, to love unloved?
This you should pity rather than despise.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERNIA</persona><text>I understand not what you mean by this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
You would not make me such an argument.
But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!

</text></speech><speech><persona>DEMETRIUS</persona><text>If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
To prove him false that says I love thee not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DEMETRIUS</persona><text>I say I love thee more than he can do.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.

</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Away, you Ethiope!
</text></speech><speech><persona>DEMETRIUS</persona><text>No, no; he'll
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
Sweet love,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>Do you not jest?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Yes, sooth; and so do you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DEMETRIUS</persona><text>I would I had your bond, for I perceive
A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
me:
Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
In earnest, shall I say?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Ay, by my life;
And never did desire to see thee more.
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
That I do hate thee and love Helena.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
You thief of love! what, have you come by night
And stolen my love's heart from him?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Fine, i'faith!
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
Now I perceive that she hath made compare
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
And with her personage, her tall personage,
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
And are you grown so high in his esteem;
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
How low am I? I am not yet so low
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
I am a right maid for my cowardice:
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
Because she is something lower than myself,
That I can match her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>Lower! hark, again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
I evermore did love you, Hermia,
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
And now, so you will let me quiet go,
To Athens will I bear my folly back
And follow you no further: let me go:
You see how simple and how fond I am.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>What, with Lysander?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>With Demetrius.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DEMETRIUS</persona><text>No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
She was a vixen when she went to school;
And though she be but little, she is fierce.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
Let me come to her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Get you gone, you dwarf;
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
You bead, you acorn.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DEMETRIUS</persona><text>You are too officious
In her behalf that scorns your services.
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
Never so little show of love to her,
Thou shalt aby it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LYSANDER</persona><text>Now she holds me not;
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DEMETRIUS</persona><text>Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HERMIA</persona><text>Never so weary, never so in woe,
Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,

Of hounds and echo in conjunction.

When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear

Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
Each under each. A cry more tuneable

Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
I cannot truly say how I came here;
But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
I came with Hermia hither: our intent
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
Without the peril of the Athenian law.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EGEUS</persona><text>Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.

Of my consent that she should be your wife.

But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
Melted as the snow, seems to me now
As the remembrance of an idle gaud
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
And will for evermore be true to it.

And, for the morning now is something worn,
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
Away with us to Athens; three and three,
We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.

The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
And as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination,
That if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
Or in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HIPPOLYTA</persona><text>But all the story of the night told over,
And all their minds transfigured so together,
More witnesseth than fancy's images
And grows to something of great constancy;

That is an old device; and it was play'd
When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
That is some satire, keen and critical,
Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.

Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
How shall we find the concord of this discord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PHILOSTRATE</persona><text>A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
Which is as brief as I have known a play;
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
The passion of loud laughter never shed.

</text></speech><speech><persona>PHILOSTRATE</persona><text>No, my noble lord;
It is not for you: I have heard it over,

Unless you can find sport in their intents,
Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
To do you service.

To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
Make periods in the midst of sentences,
Throttle their practised accent in their fears
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
And in the modesty of fearful duty
I read as much as from the rattling tongue
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.

In least speak most, to my capacity.

But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
Did scare away, or rather did affright;
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
At large discourse, while here they do remain.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine</stagedir><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>I wonder if the lion be to speak.

</text></speech><speech><persona>Wall</persona><text>In this same interlude it doth befall
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
And such a wall, as I would have you think,
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
Did whisper often very secretly.
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?

O night, which ever art when day is not!
O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Pyramus</persona><text>No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.

I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;

But mark, poor knight,
What dreadful dole is here!
Eyes, do you see?
How can it be?
O dainty duck! O dear!
Thy mantle good,

Approach, ye Furies fell!
O Fates, come, come,
Cut thread and thrum;
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!

with cheer.
Come, tears, confound;
Out, sword, and wound
The pap of Pyramus;
Ay, that left pap,
Where heart doth hop:
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
Now am I dead,
Now am I fled;
My soul is in the sky:
Tongue, lose thy light;
Moon take thy flight:
Now die, die, die, die, die.

</text></speech><speech><persona>THESEUS</persona><text>His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.

</text></speech><speech><persona>Moonshine</persona><text>All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
