Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in

</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
Before I see thee seated in that throne

I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
This is the palace of the fearful king,
And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;

Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Ah, know you not the city favours them,

Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
I am thy sovereign.
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>I am thine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EXETER</persona><text>For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EXETER</persona><text>Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
In following this usurping Henry.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLIFFORD</persona><text>Whom should he follow but his natural king?
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>It must and shall be so: content thyself.

</text></speech><speech><persona>WESTMORELAND</persona><text>He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
That we are those which chased you from the field
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
March'd through the city to the palace gates.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NORTHUMBERLAND</persona><text>Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WESTMORELAND</persona><text>Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLIFFORD</persona><text>Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
As shall revenge his death before I stir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>Will you we show our title to the crown?
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
And seized upon their towns and provinces.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>The lord protector lost it, and not I:
When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EDWARD</persona><text>Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MONTAGUE</persona><text>Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
And be you silent and attentive too,
For he that interrupts him shall not live.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
My title's good, and better far than his.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>'Twas by rebellion against his king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>  I know not what to say; my title's weak.--
Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>What then?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>An if he may, then am I lawful king;
For Richard, in the view of many lords,
Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>He rose against him, being his sovereign,
And made him to resign his crown perforce.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
</text></speech><speech><persona>EXETER</persona><text>No; for he could not so resign his crown
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
</text></speech><speech><persona>EXETER</persona><text>His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
</text></speech><speech><persona>EXETER</persona><text>My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>  All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NORTHUMBERLAND</persona><text>Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NORTHUMBERLAND</persona><text>Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
Can set the duke up in despite of me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLIFFORD</persona><text>King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
Or I will fill the house with armed men,
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
Write up his title with usurping blood.

</text></speech><speech><persona>WESTMORELAND</persona><text>Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
</text></speech><speech><persona>NORTHUMBERLAND</persona><text>Be thou a prey unto the house of York,

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Ah, Exeter!
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Why should you sigh, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
But be it as it may: I here entail
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
And neither by treason nor hostility
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
</text></speech><speech><persona>YORK</persona><text>This oath I willingly take and will perform.

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>Who can be patient in such extremes?
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
And disinherited thine only son.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE EDWARD</persona><text>Father, you cannot disinherit me:
If you be king, why should not I succeed?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
And given unto the house of York such head
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
And creep into it far before thy time?
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
The duke is made protector of the realm;
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
Before I would have granted to that act.
But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
Whereby my son is disinherited.
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
And utter ruin of the house of York.
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE EDWARD</persona><text>When I return with victory from the field
I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD</stagedir><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EXETER</persona><text>And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.

That hath authority over him that swears:

Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
Within whose circuit is Elysium
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest

In them I trust; for they are soldiers,
Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,

My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
And all my followers to the eager foe
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:
But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
Like men born to renown by life or death.
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
And full as oft came Edward to my side,
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
With bootless labour swim against the tide
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:
The sands are number'd that make up my life;
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.

Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
What! was it you that would be England's king?
Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
And made a preachment of your high descent?
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
And if thine eyes can water for his death,
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
I should lament thy miserable state.
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
And this is he was his adopted heir.
But how is it that great Plantagenet
Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
As I bethink me, you should not be king
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
And rob his temples of the diadem,
Now in his life, against your holy oath?
O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLIFFORD</persona><text>That is my office, for my father's sake.

Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee abominable:
Thou art as opposite to every good
As the Antipodes are unto us,
Or as the south to the septentrion.
O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
Frenchwoman.

This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
And I with tears do wash the blood away.
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
And in thy need such comfort come to thee
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!

Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power</stagedir><speech><persona>EDWARD</persona><text>I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
The happy tidings of his good escape.
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>I cannot joy, until I be resolved
Where our right valiant father is become.
I saw him in the battle range about;
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
So fared our father with his enemies;
So fled his enemies my warlike father:
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
See how the morning opes her golden gates,
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
How well resembles it the prime of youth,
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!

Not separated with the racking clouds,
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.

As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
In this the heaven figures some event.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EDWARD</persona><text>'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
Each one already blazing by our meeds,

And over-shine the earth as this the world.
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
You love the breeder better than the male.
But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell

And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
And many strokes, though with a little axe,
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
By many hands your father was subdued;
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
They took his head, and on the gates of York
They set the same; and there it doth remain,
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EDWARD</persona><text>Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
For never henceforth shall I joy again,
Never, O never shall I see more joy!
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
Or die renowned by attempting it.

</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
And now, to add more measure to your woes,
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
I, then in London keeper of the king,
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
And very well appointed, as I thought,
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
Bearing the king in my behalf along;
For by my scouts I was advertised
That she was coming with a full intent
To dash our late decree in parliament
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
Or whether 'twas report of her success;
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
With promise of high pay and great rewards:
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
And we in them no hope to win the day;
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
For in the marches here we heard you were,
Making another head to fight again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EDWARD</persona><text>Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
And when came George from Burgundy to England?
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
And for your brother, he was lately sent
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.

Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
Were he as famous and as bold in war
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
But in this troublous time what's to be done?
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
And therefore comes my brother Montague.
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
And of their feather many more proud birds,
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
He swore consent to your succession,
His oath enrolled in the parliament;
And now to London all the crew are gone,
To frustrate both his oath and what beside
May make against the house of Lancaster.
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
But never once again turn back and fly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,

Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,

He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
And long hereafter say unto his child,
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
My careless father fondly gave away'?
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;

I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;

For all the rest is held at such a rate

Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?

When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
Your legs did better service than your hands.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLIFFORD</persona><text>You said so much before, and yet you fled.

Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
The execution of my big-swoln heart
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLIFFORD</persona><text>I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.

Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
By him that made us all, I am resolved
that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.

A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.

For York in justice puts his armour on.

There is no wrong, but every thing is right.

For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
</text></speech><speech><persona>RICHARD</persona><text>Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
Whose father bears the title of a king,--

Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
</text></speech><speech><persona>EDWARD</persona><text>A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
To make this shameless callet know herself.
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
By that false woman, as this king by thee.
His father revell'd in the heart of France,
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
And had he match'd according to his state,
He might have kept that glory to this day;
But when he took a beggar to his bed,
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
And we, in pity of the gentle king,
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GEORGE</persona><text>But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
And that thy summer bred us no increase,
We set the axe to thy usurping root;
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EDWARD</persona><text>And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
Not willing any longer conference,
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
And either victory, or else a grave.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>Stay, Edward.
</text></speech><speech><persona>EDWARD</persona><text>No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.

When dying clouds contend with growing light,
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
Now one the better, then another best;
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
So is the equal of this fell war.
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
To whom God will, there be the victory!
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
They prosper best of all when I am thence.
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
For what is in this world but grief and woe?
O God! methinks it were a happy life,
To be no better than a homely swain;
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
How many make the hour full complete;
How many hours bring about the day;
How many days will finish up the year;
How many years a mortal man may live.
When this is known, then to divide the times:
So many hours must I tend my flock;
So many hours must I take my rest;
So many hours must I contemplate;
So many hours must I sport myself;
So many days my ewes have been with young;
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
Pass'd over to the end they were created,
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
His body couched in a curious bed,
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
Or as thy father and his father did,
Giving no ground unto the house of York,
They never then had sprung like summer flies;
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death;
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?

Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:

And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread

Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
And in conclusion wins the king from her,
With promise of his sister, and what else,

</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Keeper</persona><text>Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
Your crown content and you must be contented
To go along with us; for as we think,
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
Will apprehend you as his enemy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>But did you never swear, and break an oath?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Keeper</persona><text>No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Keeper</persona><text>Here in this country, where we now remain.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>I was anointed king at nine months old;
My father and my grandfather were kings,
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Keeper</persona><text>No;
For we were subjects but while you were king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
And as the air blows it to me again,
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
And yielding to another when it blows,
Commanded always by the greater gust;
Such is the lightness of you common men.
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Keeper</persona><text>We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>So would you be again to Henry,
If he were seated as King Edward is.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Keeper</persona><text>We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
To go with us unto the officers.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
And what God will, that let your king perform;
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.

LADY GREY</stagedir><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
Which we in justice cannot well deny,
Because in quarrel of the house of York
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
It were dishonour to deny it her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>  Yea, is it so?
I see the lady hath a thing to grant,
Before the king will grant her humble suit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLARENCE</persona><text>  He knows the game: how true
he keeps the wind!
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>  Silence!
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Widow, we will consider of your suit;
And come some other time to know our mind.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
May it please your highness to resolve me now;
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>  Ay, widow? then I'll warrant
you all your lands,
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLARENCE</persona><text>  I fear her not, unless she
chance to fall.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text> God forbid that! for he'll
take vantages.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLARENCE</persona><text>  I think he means to beg a
child of her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>  Nay, whip me then: he'll rather
give her two.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>Three, my most gracious lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>  You shall have four, if you'll
be ruled by him.

</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>  Ay, good leave have you; for
you will have leave,

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>And would you not do much to do them good?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>To do them good, I would sustain some harm.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>Therefore I came unto your majesty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>What you command, that rests in me to do.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>But you will take exceptions to my boon.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>  He plies her hard; and much rain
wears the marble.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLARENCE</persona><text>  As red as fire! nay, then
her wax must melt.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>  The match is made; she seals it
with a curtsy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>But now you partly may perceive my mind.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>My mind will never grant what I perceive
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
For by that loss I will not purchase them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>  The widow likes him not, she
knits her brows.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLARENCE</persona><text>  He is the bluntest wooer in
Christendom.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;
Her words do show her wit incomparable;
All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
One way or other, she is for a king;
And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
I am a subject fit to jest withal,
But far unfit to be a sovereign.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
I speak no more than what my soul intends;
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>And that is more than I will yield unto:
I know I am too mean to be your queen,
And yet too good to be your concubine.

</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY GREY</persona><text>'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.

Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing

Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.

</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>By so much is the wonder in extremes.

And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING EDWARD IV</persona><text>See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
To question of his apprehension.
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</stagedir><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
To cross me from the golden time I look for!
And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
The lustful Edward's title buried--
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
A cold premeditation for my purpose!
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
Like one that stands upon a promontory,
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
Flattering me with impossibilities.
My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
What other pleasure can the world afford?
I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
And deck my body in gay ornaments,
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
O miserable thought! and more unlikely
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
To make an envious mountain on my back,
Where sits deformity to mock my body;
To shape my legs of an unequal size;
To disproportion me in every part,
Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
That carries no impression like the dam.
And am I then a man to be beloved?
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
As are of better person than myself,
I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
And yet I know not how to get the crown,
For many lives stand between me and home:
And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
Seeking a way and straying from the way;
Not knowing how to find the open air,
But toiling desperately to find it out,--
Torment myself to catch the English crown:
And from that torment I will free myself,
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
And frame my face to all occasions.
I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
I can add colours to the chameleon,
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.

Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
But now mischance hath trod my title down,
And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
And to my humble seat conform myself.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING LEWIS XI</persona><text>Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING LEWIS XI</persona><text>Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
And sit thee by our side:
Yield not thy neck
To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
Is of a king become a banish'd man,
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
Usurps the regal title and the seat
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
Our people and our peers are both misled,
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING LEWIS XI</persona><text>Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
While we bethink a means to break it off.

For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
And then to crave a league of amity;
And lastly, to confirm that amity
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
To England's king in lawful marriage.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;
Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,
Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
</text></speech><speech><persona>QUEEN MARGARET</persona><text>King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
Before you answer Warwick. His demand
Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
But from deceit bred by necessity;
For how can tyrants safely govern home,
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Injurious Margaret!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE EDWARD</persona><text>And why not queen?
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Because thy father Henry did usurp;
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OXFORD</persona><text>Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
Who by his prowess conquered all France:
From these our Henry lineally descends.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
Of threescore and two years; a silly time
To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OXFORD</persona><text>Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OXFORD</persona><text>Call him my king by whose injurious doom
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
When nature brought him to the door of death?
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>And I the house of York.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING LEWIS XI</persona><text>Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING LEWIS XI</persona><text>Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING LEWIS XI</persona><text>But is he gracious in the people's eye?
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>The more that Henry was unfortunate.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING LEWIS XI</persona><text>Then further, all dissembling set aside,
Tell me for truth the measure of his love
Unto our sister Bona.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>Such it seems
As may beseem a monarch like himself.
Myself have often heard him say and swear
That this his love was an eternal plant,
Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING LEWIS XI</persona><text>Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BONA</persona><text>Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
Yet I confess that often ere this day,
When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING LEWIS XI</persona><text>Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
Touching the jointure that your king must make,
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE EDWARD</persona><text>To Edward, but not to the English king.

This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>WARWICK</persona><text>King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
No more my king, for he dishonours me,
But most himself, if he could see his shame.
Did I forget that by the house of York
My father came untimely to his death?
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
Did I impale him with the regal crown?
Did I put Henry from his native right?
And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
And to repair my honour lost for him,
I here renounce him and return to Henry.
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,

That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
I'll undertake to land them on our coast
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
He's very likely now to fall from him,
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
Or than for strength and safety of our country.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BONA</persona><text>Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged

Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
Not that I pity Henry's misery,
But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.

They are already, or quickly will be landed:
Myself in person will straight follow you.
But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
If it be so, then both depart to him;
I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
That I may never have you in suspect.

We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:

With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
At unawares may beat down Edward's guard

But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,

To bend the fatal instruments of war
Against his brother and his lawful king?
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:

I am so sorry for my trespass made
That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.

</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE EDWARD</persona><text>I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
I am your better, traitors as ye are:
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.

Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.

To make a bloody supper in the Tower.

Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.

'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
Have now the fatal object in my eye
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
That taught his son the office of a fowl!
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
Than can my ears that tragic history.
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>Think'st thou I am an executioner?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:

</text></speech><speech><persona>GLOUCESTER</persona><text>Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING HENRY VI</persona><text>Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
And orphans for their parents timeless death--
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
To signify thou camest to bite the world:
And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
Thou camest--

Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
For hardy and undoubted champions;
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
And two Northumberlands; two braver men
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
And made our footstool of security.
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.

  To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master,
And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.

And now what rests but that we spend the time
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.
