</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death

whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAFEU</persona><text>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
than lack it where there is such abundance.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAFEU</persona><text>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
finds no other advantage in the process but only the
losing of hope by time.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
far, would have made nature immortal, and death
should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
the death of the king's disease.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAFEU</persona><text>How called you the man you speak of, madam?
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAFEU</persona><text>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
could be set up against mortality.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAFEU</persona><text>A fistula, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>I heard not of it before.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAFEU</persona><text>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
her education promises; her dispositions she
inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
traitors too; in her they are the better for their
simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAFEU</persona><text>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
a sorrow than have it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LAFEU</persona><text>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
excessive grief the enemy to the living.

</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
Advise him.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Under Mars, I.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>I especially think, under Mars.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Why under Mars?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
be born under Mars.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>When he was predominant.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Why think you so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>You go so much backward when you fight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>That's for advantage.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
but the composition that your valour and fear makes
in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
What power is it which mounts my love so high,
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes and kiss like native things.
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
So show her merit, that did miss her love?
The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU</stagedir><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>O, were that all! I think not on my father;
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
I have forgot him: my imagination
Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
I am undone: there is no living, none,
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
That I should love a bright particular star
And think to wed it, he is so above me:
In his bright radiance and collateral light
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
The hind that would be mated by the lion
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
To see him every hour; to sit and draw
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
In our heart's table; heart too capable
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
And yet I know him a notorious liar,
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Save you, fair queen!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>And you, monarch!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>No.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>And no.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Are you meditating on virginity?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
may we barricado it against him?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Keep him out.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
warlike resistance.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
undermine you and blow you up.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
virgins might blow up men?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
increase and there was never virgin got till
virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
virginity murders itself and should be buried in
highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
now. Your date is better in your pie and your
porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
your old virginity, is like one of our French
withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Not my virginity yet
There shall your master have a thousand loves,
A mother and a mistress and a friend,
A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
His humble ambition, proud humility,
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
I know not what he shall. God send him well!
The court's a learning place, and he is one--
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>What one, i' faith?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>That I wish well. 'Tis pity--
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>What's pity?
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>That wishing well had not a body in't,
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
Might with effects of them follow our friends,
And show what we alone must think, which never
Return us thanks.

Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>My thanks and duty are your majesty's.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING</persona><text>I would I had that corporal soundness now,
As when thy father and myself in friendship
First tried our soldiership! He did look far
Into the service of the time and was
Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
But on us both did haggish age steal on
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
To talk of your good father. In his youth
He had the wit which I can well observe
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
Exception bid him speak, and at this time
His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
He used as creatures of another place
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
Making them proud of his humility,
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
Might be a copy to these younger times;
Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
But goers backward.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>His good remembrance, sir,
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING</persona><text>Would I were with him! He would always say--
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
This his good melancholy oft began,
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
I after him do after him wish too,
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
To give some labourers room.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>You are loved, sir:
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING</persona><text>I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
Since the physician at your father's died?
He was much famed.

</text></speech><speech><persona>KING</persona><text>If he were living, I would try him yet.
Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
With several applications; nature and sickness

</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
the complaints I have heard of you I do not all

enough to make such knaveries yours.

</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>Well, sir.

</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
heritage: and I think I shall never have the

they say barnes are blessings.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>Is this all your worship's reason?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
are.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>May the world know them?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
that I may repent.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have
friends for my wife's sake.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the
knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my
drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in
religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl
horns together, like any deer i' the herd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next

For I the ballad will repeat,
Which men full true shall find;
Your marriage comes by destiny,
Your cuckoo sings by kind.

Helen, I mean.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
Fond done, done fond,
Was this King Priam's joy?
With that she sighed as she stood,
With that she sighed as she stood,
And gave this sentence then;
Among nine bad if one be good,
Among nine bad if one be good,
There's yet one good in ten.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying
o' the song: would God would serve the world so all
the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we
might have a good woman born but one every blazing
star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery
well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck
one.

</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>That man should be at woman's command, and yet no

Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
That's able to breathe life into a stone,
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
And write to her a love-line.

If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
If seriously I may convey my thoughts
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
For that is her demand, and know her business?
That done, laugh well at me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING</persona><text>Now, good Lafeu,
Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine

</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>From below your duke to beneath your constable, it

</text></speech><speech><persona>COUNTESS</persona><text>It must be an answer of most monstrous size that

sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

She had her breeding at my father's charge.
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
Rather corrupt me ever!
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING</persona><text>'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
In differences so mighty. If she be
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
The property by what it is should go,
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
In these to nature she's immediate heir,
And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
Which challenges itself as honour's born
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
When rather from our acts we them derive
Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
I can create the rest: virtue and she
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.

I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
That dost in vile misprision shackle up
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
We, poising us in her defective scale,
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
It is in us to plant thine honour where
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
Believe not thy disdain, but presently
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Into the staggers and the careless lapse
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
What great creation and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
Is as 'twere born so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING</persona><text>Take her by the hand,
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.

Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;

Those tender limbs of thine to the event
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
Whoever charges on his forward breast,
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
His death was so effected: better 'twere
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
That all the miseries which nature owes
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
My being here it is that holds thee hence:
Shall I stay here to do't?  no, no, although
The air of paradise did fan the house
And angels officed all: I will be gone,

To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!

Ambitious love hath so in me offended,

With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
His name with zealous fervor sanctify:
His taken labours bid him me forgive;
I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:
He is too good and fair for death and me:
Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.

Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear

Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
To this unworthy husband of his wife;
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
He will return; and hope I may that she,
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
Led hither by pure love: which of them both
Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
To make distinction: provide this messenger:
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
Which I will over-pay and pay again
When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
Now his important blood will nought deny
That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
That downward hath succeeded in his house
From son to son, some four or five descents
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
Howe'er repented after.

The bottom of your purpose.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
Herself most chastely absent: after this,
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
To what is passed already.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Widow</persona><text>I have yielded:
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
That time and place with this deceit so lawful
May prove coherent. Every night he comes
With musics of all sorts and songs composed
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
As if his life lay on't.
</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>Why then to-night
Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
And lawful meaning in a lawful act,

And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
In your fine frame hath love no quality?
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
You are no maiden, but a monument:
When you are dead, you should be such a one
As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
And now you should be as your mother was
When your sweet self was got.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DIANA</persona><text>She then was honest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>So should you be.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DIANA</persona><text>No:

As you owe to your wife.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>No more o' that;

I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
Do thee all rights of service.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DIANA</persona><text>Ay, so you serve us

But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
What is not holy, that we swear not by,
But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
If I should swear by God's great attributes,
I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
To swear by him whom I protest to love,
That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
At least in my opinion.

</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in

fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself

</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
what things are we!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
of all treasons, we still see them reveal
themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
so he that in this action contrives against his own
nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
company to-night?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
set this counterfeit.

presence must be the whip of the other.

</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
of his council.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal
of his act.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
now she sings in heaven.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>How is this justified?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
makes her story true, even to the point of her
death: her death itself, which could not be her
office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
the rector of the place.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>Hath the count all this intelligence?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
point, so to the full arming of the verity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
with a shame as ample.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.

were more than they can commend.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
Here's his lordship now.
How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
that I have not ended yet.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>If the business be of any difficulty, and this
morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
your lordship.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
me, like a double-meaning prophesier.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
poor gallant knave.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>Nothing of me, has a'?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his

and credit and as I hope to live.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>Shall I set down your answer so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
his dagger.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
by wearing his apparel neatly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>Well, that's set down.

true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>He's very near the truth in this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
delivers it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Poor rogues, I pray you, say.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>Well, that's set down.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
rogues are marvellous poor.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>  'Demand of him, of what strength they are
a-foot.' What say you to that?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>What shall be done to him?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
condition, and what credit I have with the duke.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>Well, that's set down.
'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is
with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not
possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what
do you know of it?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
the inter'gatories: demand them singly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>Do you know this Captain Dumain?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not
say him nay.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
lordship anon.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>What is his reputation with the duke?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>Marry, we'll search.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
in my tent.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>I do not know if it be it or no.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>Our interpreter does it well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>Excellently.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>  'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>Damnable both-sides rogue!
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>  'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
After he scores, he never pays the score:
Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
PAROLLES.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
in's forehead.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
linguist and the armipotent soldier.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
he's a cat to me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be
fain to hang you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
die; but that, my offences being many, I would
repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
his valour: what is his honesty?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
such volubility, that you would think truth were a
fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
every thing that an honest man should not have; what
an honest man should have, he has nothing.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>I begin to love him for this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
him for me, he's more and more a cat.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Soldier</persona><text>What say you to his expertness in war?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAROLLES</persona><text>Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
this I am not certain.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
rarity redeems him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BERTRAM</persona><text>A pox on him, he's a cat still.

May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
Send for your ring, I will return it home,
And give me mine again.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>No, my good lord;

The name and not the thing.

</text></speech><speech><persona>HELENA</persona><text>O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
'When from my finger you can get this ring
And are by me with child,' &amp;c. This is done:
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KING</persona><text>Let us from point to point this story know,
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
For I can guess that by thy honest aid
Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
Of that and all the progress, more or less,
Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
