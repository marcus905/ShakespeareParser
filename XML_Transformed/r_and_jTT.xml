</text></speech><speech><persona>SAMPSON</persona><text>I strike quickly, being moved.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GREGORY</persona><text>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SAMPSON</persona><text>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GREGORY</persona><text>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SAMPSON</persona><text>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GREGORY</persona><text>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
to the wall.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SAMPSON</persona><text>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wall.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GREGORY</persona><text>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SAMPSON</persona><text>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, and cut off their heads.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GREGORY</persona><text>The heads of the maids?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SAMPSON</persona><text>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.
</text></speech><speech><persona>GREGORY</persona><text>They must take it in sense that feel it.

Or manage it to part these men with me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TYBALT</persona><text>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!

Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You Capulet; shall go along with me:
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our further pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO</stagedir><speech><persona>MONTAGUE</persona><text>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY MONTAGUE</persona><text>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MONTAGUE</persona><text>Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the furthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night:
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MONTAGUE</persona><text>I neither know it nor can learn of him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Have you importuned him by any means?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MONTAGUE</persona><text>Both by myself and many other friends:
But he, his own affections' counsellor,
Is to himself--I will not say how true--
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
We would as willingly give cure as know.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter ROMEO</stagedir><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MONTAGUE</persona><text>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</stagedir><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Good-morrow, cousin.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Is the day so young?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>But new struck nine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>In love?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Out--
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Of love?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Out of her favour, where I am in love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>No, coz, I rather weep.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Good heart, at what?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>At thy good heart's oppression.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>What, shall I groan and tell thee?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>O, teach me how I should forget to think.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
</text></speech></speeches></scene><scene><title>SCENE II.  A street.</title><speeches><stagedir>Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant</stagedir><speech><persona>CAPULET</persona><text>But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PARIS</persona><text>Of honourable reckoning are you both;
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAPULET</persona><text>But saying o'er what I have said before:
My child is yet a stranger in the world;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
Let two more summers wither in their pride,
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PARIS</persona><text>Younger than she are happy mothers made.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAPULET</persona><text>And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
An she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love; and you, among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well-apparell'd April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which on more view, of many mine being one
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
Come, go with me.
Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS</stagedir><speech><persona>Servant</persona><text>Find them out whose names are written here! It is
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his

his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ, and can never find what names the writing
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO</stagedir><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>For what, I pray thee?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>For your broken shin.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Servant</persona><text>God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Servant</persona><text>Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
pray, can you read any thing you see?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

</text></speech><speech><persona>Nurse</persona><text>I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY CAPULET</persona><text>A fortnight and odd days.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Nurse</persona><text>Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me: but, as I said,
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge:
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before, she broke her brow:
And then my husband--God be with his soul!
A' was a merry man--took up the child:
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY CAPULET</persona><text>Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Nurse</persona><text>Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:

Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY CAPULET</persona><text>Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers: by my count,
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

</text></speech><speech><persona>LADY CAPULET</persona><text>What say you? can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content
And what obscured in this fair volume lies
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide:
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Nurse</persona><text>No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MERCUTIO</persona><text>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
Then dreams, he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she--
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROMEO</persona><text>Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MERCUTIO</persona><text>True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BENVOLIO</persona><text>This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date

By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;

Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
What is her burying grave that is her womb,
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find,
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give,
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
And vice sometimes by action dignified.
Within the infant rind of this small flower
Poison hath residence and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

Within this hour my man shall be with thee

sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer

Your high displeasure: all this uttered

Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.

Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast:
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
Romeo is coming.

So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,

Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?

Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body

Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion;
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
She's not well married that lives married long;
But she's best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
In all her best array bear her to church:
For though fond nature bids us an lament,
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.

</text></speech><speech><persona>BALTHASAR</persona><text>I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
I departed not and left him there.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE</persona><text>Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PAGE</persona><text>He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCE</persona><text>This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAPULET</persona><text>O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more

</text></speech><speech><persona>MONTAGUE</persona><text>But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAPULET</persona><text>As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;

Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;

Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
