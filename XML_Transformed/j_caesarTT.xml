What tributaries follow him to Rome,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The livelong day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire?
And do you now cull out a holiday?
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FLAVIUS</persona><text>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
Into the channel, till the lowest stream
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
See whether their basest metal be not moved;
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
This way will I disrobe the images,
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARULLUS</persona><text>May we do so?
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FLAVIUS</persona><text>It is no matter; let no images
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
Who else would soar above the view of men
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.

</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
I'll leave you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
I have not from your eyes that gentleness
And show of love as I was wont to have:
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Cassius,
Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
Of late with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
Nor construe any further my neglect,
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Forgets the shows of love to other men.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
But by reflection, by some other things.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>'Tis just:
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
And since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester; if you know
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
And after scandal them, or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Flourish, and shout</stagedir><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
Choose Caesar for their king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
And I will look on both indifferently,
For let the gods so speed me as I love
The name of honour more than I fear death.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favour.
Well, honour is the subject of my story.
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
We both have fed as well, and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
Is now become a god, and Cassius is
A wretched creature and must bend his body,
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their colour fly,
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestic world
And bear the palm alone.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Shout. Flourish</stagedir><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus, and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs and peep about
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
Men at some time are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
When there is in it but one only man.
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
As easily as a king.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
What you would work me to, I have some aim:
How I have thought of this and of these times,
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
Be any further moved. What you have said
I will consider; what you have to say
I will with patience hear, and find a time
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
Brutus had rather be a villager
Than to repute himself a son of Rome
Under these hard conditions as this time
Is like to lay upon us.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>I am glad that my weak words
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>The games are done and Caesar is returning.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</stagedir><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
And all the rest look like a chidden train:
Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
As we have seen him in the Capitol,
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Casca will tell us what the matter is.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>Antonius!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Caesar?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>Let me have men about me that are fat;
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
He is a noble Roman and well given.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
He is a great observer and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
That could be moved to smile at any thing.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
And therefore are they very dangerous.
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA</stagedir><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
That Caesar looks so sad.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Why, you were with him, were you not?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>What was the second noise for?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Why, for that too.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Why, for that too.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Was the crown offered him thrice?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
mine honest neighbours shouted.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Who offered him the crown?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Why, Antony.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
mouth, and was speechless.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
displeased them, as they use to do the players in
the theatre, I am no true man.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>What said he when he came unto himself?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Ay.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Did Cicero say any thing?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Ay, he spoke Greek.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>To what effect?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
face again: but those that understood him smiled at
one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
remember it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>No, I am promised forth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Will you dine with me to-morrow?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
worth the eating.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Good: I will expect you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Do so. Farewell, both.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
He was quick mettle when he went to school.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>So is he now in execution
Of any bold or noble enterprise,
However he puts on this tardy form.
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
Which gives men stomach to digest his words
With better appetite.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
I will come home to you; or, if you will,
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>I will do so: till then, think of the world.
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
Thy honourable metal may be wrought
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
He should not humour me. I will this night,
In several hands, in at his windows throw,
As if they came from several citizens,
Writings all tending to the great opinion
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

And yesterday the bird of night did sit
Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
For, I believe, they are portentous things
Unto the climate that they point upon.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CICERO</persona><text>Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
But men may construe things after their fashion,
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>He doth; for he did bid Antonius
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CICERO</persona><text>Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
Is not to walk in.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Farewell, Cicero.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter CASSIUS</stagedir><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Who's there?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>A Roman.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Casca, by your voice.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>A very pleasing night to honest men.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
Submitting me unto the perilous night,
And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
The breast of heaven, I did present myself
Even in the aim and very flash of it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
When the most mighty gods by tokens send
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
That should be in a Roman you do want,
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
But if you would consider the true cause
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
Why old men fool and children calculate,
Why all these things change from their ordinance
Their natures and preformed faculties
To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
To make them instruments of fear and warning
Unto some monstrous state.
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
Most like this dreadful night,
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
As doth the lion in the Capitol,
A man no mightier than thyself or me
In personal action, yet prodigious grown
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Let it be who it is: for Romans now
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
In every place, save here in Italy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>I know where I will wear this dagger then;
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
If I know this, know all the world besides,
That part of tyranny that I do bear
I can shake off at pleasure.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Thunder still</stagedir><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>So can I:
So every bondman in his own hand bears
The power to cancel his captivity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
For the base matter to illuminate
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
Before a willing bondman; then I know
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
And dangers are to me indifferent.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>You speak to Casca, and to such a man
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
And I will set this foot of mine as far
As who goes farthest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>There's a bargain made.
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
To undergo with me an enterprise
Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
And I do know, by this, they stay for me
In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
There is no stir or walking in the streets;
And the complexion of the element
In favour's like the work we have in hand,
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
He is a friend.
Cinna, where haste you so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CINNA</persona><text>To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>No, it is Casca; one incorporate
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CINNA</persona><text>I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CINNA</persona><text>Yes, you are.
O Cassius, if you could
But win the noble Brutus to our party--
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
In at his window; set this up with wax
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CINNA</persona><text>All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
Is ours already, and the man entire
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASCA</persona><text>O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
And that which would appear offence in us,
His countenance, like richest alchemy,
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Him and his worth and our great need of him
You have right well conceited. Let us go,
For it is after midnight; and ere day
We will awake him and be sure of him.

</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
And every man hence to his idle bed;
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
What need we any spur but our own cause,
To prick us to redress? what other bond
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
And will not palter? and what other oath
Than honesty to honesty engaged,
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise,
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Is guilty of a several bastardy,
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.

</text></speech><speech><persona>METELLUS CIMBER</persona><text>O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
Will purchase us a good opinion
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
But all be buried in his gravity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>O, name him not: let us not break with him;
For he will never follow any thing

</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
If he improve them, may well stretch so far
As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
Our purpose necessary and not envious:
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
When Caesar's head is off.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Yet I fear him;
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
If he love Caesar, all that he can do
Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
And that were much he should; for he is given
To sports, to wildness and much company.

</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>But it is doubtful yet,
Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
For he is superstitious grown of late,
Quite from the main opinion he held once
Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
It may be, these apparent prodigies,
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
And the persuasion of his augurers,
May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DECIUS BRUTUS</persona><text>Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
He says he does, being then most flattered.
Let me work;
For I can give his humour the true bent,
And I will bring him to the Capitol.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?

I wonder none of you have thought of him.

He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
Fearing to strengthen that impatience
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
And could it work so much upon your shape
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,

To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
You have some sick offence within your mind,
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
By all your vows of love and that great vow
Which did incorporate and make us one,
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
Have had to resort to you: for here have been
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
Even from darkness.

Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
Is it excepted I should know no secrets
That appertain to you? Am I yourself
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.

As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
That visit my sad heart
</text></speech><speech><persona>PORTIA</persona><text>If this were true, then should I know this secret.
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
I grant I am a woman; but withal
A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
Being so father'd and so husbanded?
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
I have made strong proof of my constancy,
Giving myself a voluntary wound
Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
And not my husband's secrets?

</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>Cowards die many times before their deaths;
The valiant never taste of death but once.
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come.
What say the augurers?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Servant</persona><text>They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
They could not find a heart within the beast.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
We are two lions litter'd in one day,
And I the elder and more terrible:
And Caesar shall go forth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CALPURNIA</persona><text>Alas, my lord,
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
And he shall say you are not well to-day:
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DECIUS BRUTUS</persona><text>Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>And you are come in very happy time,
To bear my greeting to the senators
And tell them that I will not come to-day:
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CALPURNIA</persona><text>Say he is sick.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>Shall Caesar send a lie?
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DECIUS BRUTUS</persona><text>Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>The cause is in my will: I will not come;
That is enough to satisfy the senate.
But for your private satisfaction,
Because I love you, I will let you know:
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
And evils imminent; and on her knee
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DECIUS BRUTUS</persona><text>This dream is all amiss interpreted;
It was a vision fair and fortunate:
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>And this way have you well expounded it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DECIUS BRUTUS</persona><text>I have, when you have heard what I can say:
And know it now: the senate have concluded
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
If you shall send them word you will not come,
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
'Break up the senate till another time,
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
And reason to my love is liable.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
I am ashamed I did yield to them.
Give me my robe, for I will go.
And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PUBLIUS</persona><text>Good morrow, Caesar.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CAESAR</persona><text>Welcome, Publius.
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
As that same ague which hath made you lean.
What is 't o'clock?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.

If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
</text></speech><speech><persona>All</persona><text>None, Brutus, none.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
enforced, for which he suffered death.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
the benefit of his dying, a place in the
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
when it shall please my country to need my death.

I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
For Brutus is an honourable man;
So are they all, all honourable men--
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;

</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honourable men:
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honourable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
Let but the commons hear this testament--
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Fourth Citizen</persona><text>We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
</text></speech><speech><persona>All</persona><text>The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Fourth Citizen</persona><text>Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
I fear I wrong the honourable men
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Fourth Citizen</persona><text>They were traitors: honourable men!
</text></speech><speech><persona>All</persona><text>The will! the testament!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Citizen</persona><text>They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>You will compel me, then, to read the will?
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
And let me show you him that made the will.
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Several Citizens</persona><text>Come down.

You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii:
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Citizen</persona><text>O piteous spectacle!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Citizen</persona><text>O noble Caesar!
</text></speech><speech><persona>Third Citizen</persona><text>O woful day!

</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Stay, countrymen.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Citizen</persona><text>Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Citizen</persona><text>We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honourable:
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend; and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him:
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Caesar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
</text></speech><speech><persona>All</persona><text>We'll mutiny.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Citizen</persona><text>We'll burn the house of Brutus.

</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
</text></speech><speech><persona>All</persona><text>Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
You have forgot the will I told you of.
</text></speech><speech><persona>All</persona><text>Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
To every Roman citizen he gives,
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Citizen</persona><text>Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Third Citizen</persona><text>O royal Caesar!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Hear me with patience.
</text></speech><speech><persona>All</persona><text>Peace, ho!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Citizen</persona><text>Never, never. Come, away, away!
We'll burn his body in the holy place,
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.

To wind, to stop, to run directly on,

He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
On abjects, orts and imitations,
Which, out of use and staled by other men,
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
But as a property. And now, Octavius,
Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
Therefore let our alliance be combined,
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
And let us presently go sit in council,
How covert matters may be best disclosed,
And open perils surest answered.

By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
By any indirection: I did send

Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?

Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
And here my naked breast; within, a heart
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.

Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
And straight is cold again.

I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Come in, Titinius!
Welcome, good Messala.
Now sit we close about this taper here,
And call in question our necessities.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Portia, art thou gone?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>No more, I pray you.
Messala, I have here received letters,
That young Octavius and Mark Antony
Come down upon us with a mighty power,
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>With what addition?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
Have put to death an hundred senators.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Therein our letters do not well agree;
Mine speak of seventy senators that died
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Cicero one!
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>Cicero is dead,
And by that order of proscription.
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>No, Messala.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Nothing, Messala.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>That, methinks, is strange.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>No, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
With meditating that she must die once,
I have the patience to endure it now.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>Even so great men great losses should endure.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>I have as much of this in art as you,
But yet my nature could not bear it so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Well, to our work alive. What do you think
Of marching to Philippi presently?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>I do not think it good.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Your reason?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>This it is:
'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
Do stand but in a forced affection;
For they have grudged us contribution:
The enemy, marching along by them,
By them shall make a fuller number up,
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
From which advantage shall we cut him off,
If at Philippi we do face him there,
These people at our back.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Hear me, good brother.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Under your pardon. You must note beside,
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
The enemy increaseth every day;
We, at the height, are ready to decline.
There is a tide in the affairs of men,
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
Omitted, all the voyage of their life
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
On such a full sea are we now afloat;
And we must take the current when it serves,
Or lose our ventures.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Then, with your will, go on;
We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
And nature must obey necessity;
Which we will niggard with a little rest.
There is no more to say?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>No more. Good night:
Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Lucius!
My gown.
Farewell, good Messala:
Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
Good night, and good repose.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>O my dear brother!
This was an ill beginning of the night:
Never come such division 'tween our souls!
Let it not, Brutus.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Every thing is well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Good night, my lord.

</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Farewell, every one.
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?

</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>What, thou speak'st drowsily?
Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.

Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCIUS</persona><text>Ay, my lord, an't please you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>It does, my boy:
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCIUS</persona><text>It is my duty, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCIUS</persona><text>I have slept, my lord, already.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
I will be good to thee.
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thou art.

</text></speech><speech><persona>GHOST</persona><text>Ay, at Philippi.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCIUS</persona><text>The strings, my lord, are false.

</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>  What says my general?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Messala,
This is my birth-day; as this very day
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
Be thou my witness that against my will,
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
Upon one battle all our liberties.
You know that I held Epicurus strong
And his opinion: now I change my mind,
And partly credit things that do presage.
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
Who to Philippi here consorted us:
This morning are they fled away and gone;
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
A canopy most fatal, under which
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>Believe not so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>I but believe it partly;
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
To meet all perils very constantly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Even so, Lucilius.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Now, most noble Brutus,
The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
If we do lose this battle, then is this
The very last time we shall speak together:
What are you then determined to do?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Even by the rule of that philosophy
By which I did blame Cato for the death
Which he did give himself, I know not how,
But I do find it cowardly and vile,
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
The time of life: arming myself with patience
To stay the providence of some high powers
That govern us below.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>Then, if we lose this battle,
You are contented to be led in triumph
Thorough the streets of Rome?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
He bears too great a mind. But this same day
Must end that work the ides of March begun;
And whether we shall meet again I know not.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
If not, why then, this parting was well made.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CASSIUS</persona><text>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
The end of this day's business ere it come!
But it sufficeth that the day will end,
And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!

As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,

The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!

Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
As tidings of this sight.

And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.

Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Are yet two Romans living such as these?
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
It is impossible that ever Rome
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
His funerals shall not be in our camp,
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
We shall try fortune in a second fight.

</text></speech><speech><persona>VOLUMNIUS</persona><text>What says my lord?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Why, this, Volumnius:
The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
I know my hour is come.
</text></speech><speech><persona>VOLUMNIUS</persona><text>Not so, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>VOLUMNIUS</persona><text>That's not an office for a friend, my lord.

</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
I found no man but he was true to me.
I shall have glory by this losing day
More than Octavius and Mark Antony
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
Hath almost ended his life's history:
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'</stagedir><speech><persona>CLITUS</persona><text>Fly, my lord, fly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Hence! I will follow.
I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
</text></speech><speech><persona>STRATO</persona><text>Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BRUTUS</persona><text>Farewell, good Strato.
Caesar, now be still:
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.

LUCILIUS, and the army</stagedir><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS</persona><text>What man is that?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
</text></speech><speech><persona>STRATO</persona><text>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
For Brutus only overcame himself,
And no man else hath honour by his death.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCILIUS</persona><text>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS</persona><text>All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>STRATO</persona><text>Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS</persona><text>Do so, good Messala.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>How died my master, Strato?
</text></speech><speech><persona>STRATO</persona><text>I held the sword, and he did run on it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MESSALA</persona><text>Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
That did the latest service to my master.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTONY</persona><text>This was the noblest Roman of them all:
All the conspirators save only he
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
He only, in a general honest thought
And common good to all, made one of them.
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS</persona><text>According to his virtue let us use him,
With all respect and rites of burial.
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
So call the field to rest; and let's away,
To part the glories of this happy day.
