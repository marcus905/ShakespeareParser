Orchard of Oliver's house.</title><speeches><stagedir>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</stagedir><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADAM</persona><text>Yonder comes my master, your brother.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
shake me up.

</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>What mar you then, sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
come to such penury?
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Know you where your are, sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Know you before whom, sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
condition of blood, you should so know me. The
courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
you are the first-born; but the same tradition
takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
nearer to his reverence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>What, boy!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
a villain that says such a father begot villains.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADAM</persona><text>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
remembrance, be at accord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Let me go, I say.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
father charged you in his will to give me good
education: you have trained me like a peasant,
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
give me the poor allottery my father left me by
testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
pray you, leave me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Get you with him, you old dog.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADAM</persona><text>Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
he would not have spoke such a word.

'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter CHARLES</stagedir><speech><persona>CHARLES</persona><text>Good morrow to your worship.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
new court?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CHARLES</persona><text>There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
banished with her father?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CHARLES</persona><text>O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
that she would have followed her exile, or have died
to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
never two ladies loved as they do.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Where will the old duke live?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CHARLES</persona><text>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
a many merry men with him; and there they live like
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CHARLES</persona><text>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
withal, that either you might stay him from his
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
and altogether against my will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
me his natural brother: therefore use thy
discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CHARLES</persona><text>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
so God keep your worship!
</text></speech><speech><persona>OLIVER</persona><text>Farewell, good Charles.
Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
people, who best know him, that I am altogether
misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.

</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
rejoice in yours.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce, I will render thee again in
affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
me see; what think you of falling in love?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>What shall be our sport, then?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>I would we could do so, for her benefits are
mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
makes very ill-favouredly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
not in the lineaments of Nature.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter TOUCHSTONE</stagedir><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
Nature's wit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
wit! whither wander you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Mistress, you must come away to your father.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Were you made the messenger?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Where learned you that oath, fool?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
yet was not the knight forsworn.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>How prove you that, in the great heap of your
knowledge?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
swear by your beards that I am a knave.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
one of these days.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
wise men do foolishly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
Monsieur Le Beau.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>With his mouth full of news.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Then shall we be news-crammed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Sport! of what colour?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>As wit and fortune will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Or as the Destinies decree.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Thou losest thy old smell.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
to perform it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>There comes an old man and his three sons,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>I could match this beginning with an old tale.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
by these presents.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
their father, making such pitiful dole over them
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Alas!
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
have lost?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>Why, this that I speak of.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
for ladies.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Or I, I promise thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>But is there any else longs to see this broken music
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
perform it.

come but in, as others do, to try with him the
strength of my youth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore

thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my

shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
the world I fill up a place, which may be better
supplied when I have made it empty.

To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
High commendation, true applause and love,
Yet such is now the duke's condition
That he misconstrues all that you have done.
The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
Which of the two was daughter of the duke
That here was at the wrestling?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LE BEAU</persona><text>Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
To keep his daughter company; whose loves
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
But I can tell you that of late this duke
Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
Grounded upon no other argument
But that the people praise her for her virtues
And pity her for her good father's sake;
And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
Hereafter, in a better world than this,
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.

Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
If with myself I hold intelligence
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your highness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE FREDERICK</persona><text>Thus do all traitors:
If their purgation did consist in words,
They are as innocent as grace itself:

Treason is not inherited, my lord;

It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
I was too young that time to value her;

Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
No: let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
Whither to go and what to bear with us;
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.

Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court?
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
I would not change it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AMIENS</persona><text>Happy is your grace,
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SENIOR</persona><text>Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
Being native burghers of this desert city,
Should in their own confines with forked heads
Have their round haunches gored.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>Indeed, my lord,
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
Did steal behind him as he lay along
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
Coursed one another down his innocent nose
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
Augmenting it with tears.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SENIOR</persona><text>But what said Jaques?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Lord</persona><text>O, yes, into a thousand similes.
First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
Thus most invectively he pierceth through
The body of the country, city, court,
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
To fright the animals and to kill them up
In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SENIOR</persona><text>And did you leave him in this contemplation?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Lord</persona><text>We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
Upon the sobbing deer.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SENIOR</persona><text>Show me the place:

For then he's full of matter.

</text></speech><speech><persona>ADAM</persona><text>What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
O my sweet master! O you memory
Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
Why would you be so fond to overcome
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
Know you not, master, to some kind of men
Their graces serve them but as enemies?
No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
O, what a world is this, when what is comely
Envenoms him that bears it!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Why, what's the matter?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADAM</persona><text>O unhappy youth!
Come not within these doors; within this roof
The enemy of all your graces lives:
Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
Yet not the son, I will not call him son
Of him I was about to call his father--
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
To burn the lodging where you use to lie
And you within it: if he fail of that,
He will have other means to cut you off.
I overheard him and his practises.
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADAM</persona><text>No matter whither, so you come not here.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
A thievish living on the common road?
This I must do, or know not what to do:
Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
I rather will subject me to the malice
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADAM</persona><text>But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
When service should in my old limbs lie lame
And unregarded age in corners thrown:
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
For in my youth I never did apply
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
The means of weakness and debility;
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
I'll do the service of a younger man
In all your business and necessities.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>O good old man, how well in thee appears
The constant service of the antique world,
When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
Where none will sweat but for promotion,
And having that, do choke their service up
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
That cannot so much as a blossom yield
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
But come thy ways; well go along together,
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
We'll light upon some settled low content.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADAM</persona><text>Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
Here lived I, but now live here no more.
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
But at fourscore it is too late a week:
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
The motley fool thus moral on the time,
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
And I did laugh sans intermission
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SENIOR</persona><text>What fool is this?
</text></speech><speech><persona>JAQUES</persona><text>O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
With observation, the which he vents
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
I am ambitious for a motley coat.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SENIOR</persona><text>Thou shalt have one.
</text></speech><speech><persona>JAQUES</persona><text>It is my only suit;
Provided that you weed your better judgments
Of all opinion that grows rank in them
That I am wise. I must have liberty
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
And they that are most galled with my folly,
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
He that a fool doth very wisely hit
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
The wise man's folly is anatomized
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
Invest me in my motley; give me leave
To speak my mind, and I will through and through
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
If they will patiently receive my medicine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SENIOR</persona><text>Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
</text></speech><speech><persona>JAQUES</persona><text>What, for a counter, would I do but good?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SENIOR</persona><text>Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
</text></speech><speech><persona>JAQUES</persona><text>Why, who cries out on pride,
That can therein tax any private party?
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
Till that the weary very means do ebb?
What woman in the city do I name,
When that I say the city-woman bears
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
Who can come in and say that I mean her,
When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
Or what is he of basest function
That says his bravery is not of my cost,
Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
His folly to the mettle of my speech?
There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?

And therefore put I on the countenance
Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
That in this desert inaccessible,
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
If ever you have look'd on better days,
If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
If ever sat at any good man's feast,
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.

And take upon command what help we have
That to your wanting may be minister'd.

Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books

</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
like it very well; but in respect that it is
private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>No more but that I know the more one sickens the
worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
means and content is without three good friends;
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
court, shepherd?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>No, truly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Then thou art damned.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>Nay, I hope.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all
on one side.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>For not being at court? Your reason.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
state, shepherd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Instance, briefly; come, instance.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
fells, you know, are greasy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>Besides, our hands are hard.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
A more sounder instance, come.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CORIN</persona><text>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
graze and my lambs suck.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
and the rams together and to offer to get your
living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
damned for this, the devil himself will have no
shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
'scape.

But the fair of Rosalind.

Then to cart with Rosalind.

Must find love's prick and Rosalind.

</text></speech><speech><persona>CELIA</persona><text>
Why should this a desert be?
For it is unpeopled? No:
Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
That shall civil sayings show:
Some, how brief the life of man
Runs his erring pilgrimage,
That the stretching of a span
Buckles in his sum of age;
Some, of violated vows
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
But upon the fairest boughs,
Or at every sentence end,
Will I Rosalinda write,
Teaching all that read to know
The quintessence of every sprite
Heaven would in little show.
Therefore Heaven Nature charged
That one body should be fill'd
With all graces wide-enlarged:
Nature presently distill'd
Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
Cleopatra's majesty,
Atalanta's better part,
Sad Lucretia's modesty.
Thus Rosalind of many parts
By heavenly synod was devised,
Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
To have the touches dearest prized.
Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
And I to live and die her slave.

lamely in the verse.

</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Who ambles Time withal?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Who doth he gallop withal?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Who stays it still withal?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Where dwell you, pretty youth?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Are you native of this place?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid to the charge of women?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>There were none principal; they were all like one
another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>I prithee, recount some of them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
your remedy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>What were his marks?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
do than to confess she does: that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
is so admired?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Did you ever cure any so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
passion something and for no passion truly any
thing, as boys and women are for the most part
cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>I would not be cured, youth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
and come every day to my cote and woo me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
where it is.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
Will you go?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ORLANDO</persona><text>With all my heart, good youth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?

Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a

the gods had made thee poetical.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AUDREY</persona><text>I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
deed and word? is it a true thing?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AUDREY</persona><text>Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art

hope thou didst feign.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AUDREY</persona><text>Would you not have me honest?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
</text></speech><speech><persona>JAQUES</persona><text>  A material fool!
</text></speech><speech><persona>AUDREY</persona><text>Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
make me honest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut

</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been

</text></speech><speech><persona>AUDREY</persona><text>Well, the gods give us joy!
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are
necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
with you to your chapel?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</persona><text>Is there none here to give the woman?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>I will not take her on gift of any man.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</persona><text>Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
</text></speech><speech><persona>JAQUES</persona><text>
Proceed, proceed I'll give her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.
</text></speech><speech><persona>JAQUES</persona><text>Will you be married, motley?
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
</text></speech><speech><persona>JAQUES</persona><text>And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
church, and have a good priest that can tell you
what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
</text></speech><speech><persona>TOUCHSTONE</persona><text>  I am not in the mind but I were better to be

'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
The cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,

Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;

That you insult, exult, and all at once,
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
As, by my faith, I see no more in you
Than without candle may go dark to bed--
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
That can entame my spirits to your worship.
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
You are a thousand times a properer man
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
And out of you she sees herself more proper

But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:

And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
But do not look for further recompense
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.

That the old carlot once was master of.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PHEBE</persona><text>Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
But what care I for words? yet words do well
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
There was a pretty redness in his lip,
A little riper and more lusty red
Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
Between the constant red and mingled damask.
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
In parcels as I did, would have gone near
To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
For what had he to do to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:
I marvel why I answer'd not again:
But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SILVIUS</persona><text>Phebe, with all my heart.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PHEBE</persona><text>I'll write it straight;

The horn, the horn, the lusty horn

My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
I know not the contents; but, as I guess
By the stern brow and waspish action
Which she did use as she was writing of it,
It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
I am but as a guiltless messenger.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Patience herself would startle at this letter
And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
This is a letter of your own device.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SILVIUS</persona><text>No, I protest, I know not the contents:
Phebe did write it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Come, come, you are a fool
And turn'd into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
I say she never did invent this letter;
This is a man's invention and his hand.
</text></speech><speech><persona>SILVIUS</persona><text>Sure, it is hers.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
</text></speech><speech><persona>SILVIUS</persona><text>So please you, for I never heard it yet;
Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
Can a woman rail thus?

</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALIND</persona><text>
Why, thy godhead laid apart,
Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
Did you ever hear such railing?
Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
That could do no vengeance to me.
Meaning me a beast.
If the scorn of your bright eyne
Have power to raise such love in mine,
Alack, in me what strange effect
Would they work in mild aspect!
Whiles you chid me, I did love;
How then might your prayers move!
He that brings this love to thee
Little knows this love in me:
And by him seal up thy mind;
Whether that thy youth and kind
Will the faithful offer take
Of me and all that I can make;
Or else by him my love deny,
And then I'll study how to die.

thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
In his own conduct, purposely to take
His brother here and put him to the sword:
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
Where meeting with an old religious man,
After some question with him, was converted
Both from his enterprise and from the world,
His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
And all their lands restored to them again
That were with him exiled. This to be true,
I do engage my life.

To one his lands withheld, and to the other
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.

That here were well begun and well begot:
And after, every of this happy number
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
According to the measure of their states.

And fall into our rustic revelry.

With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.
