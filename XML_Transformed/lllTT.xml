The king of Navarre's park.</title><speeches><stagedir>Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE
and DUMAIN</stagedir><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
The endeavor of this present breath may buy
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
And make us heirs of all eternity.
Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
That war against your own affections
And the huge army of the world's desires,--
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
Our court shall be a little Academe,
Still and contemplative in living art.
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
That are recorded in this schedule here:
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
That his own hand may strike his honour down
That violates the smallest branch herein:
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
The grosser manner of these world's delights
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
With all these living in philosophy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>I can but say their protestation over;
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
That is, to live and study here three years.
But there are other strict observances;
As, not to see a woman in that term,
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
And one day in a week to touch no food
And but one meal on every day beside,
The which I hope is not enrolled there;
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
And not be seen to wink of all the day--
When I was wont to think no harm all night
And make a dark night too of half the day--
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
I only swore to study with your grace
And stay here in your court for three years' space.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
What is the end of study? let me know.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
To know the thing I am forbid to know:
As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
When I to feast expressly am forbid;
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
When mistresses from common sense are hid;
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
Study to break it and not break my troth.
If study's gain be thus and this be so,
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>These be the stops that hinder study quite
And train our intellects to vain delight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
As, painfully to pore upon a book
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
Study me how to please the eye indeed
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
And give him light that it was blinded by.
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
Small have continual plodders ever won
Save base authority from others' books
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
That give a name to every fixed star
Have no more profit of their shining nights
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
And every godfather can give a name.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>How well he's read, to reason against reading!
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>How follows that?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Fit in his place and time.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>In reason nothing.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Something then in rhyme.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
Before the birds have any cause to sing?
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows.
So you, to study now it is too late,
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
And though I have for barbarism spoke more
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
And bide the penance of each three years' day.
Give me the paper; let me read the same;
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>  'Item, That no woman shall come within a
mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>Four days ago.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Let's see the penalty.
'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>Marry, that did I.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Sweet lord, and why?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>A dangerous law against gentility!
'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
within the term of three years, he shall endure such
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
This article, my liege, yourself must break;
For well you know here comes in embassy
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
A maid of grace and complete majesty--
About surrender up of Aquitaine
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
Therefore this article is made in vain,
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>So study evermore is overshot:
While it doth study to have what it would
It doth forget to do the thing it should,
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>We must of force dispense with this decree;
She must lie here on mere necessity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Necessity will make us all forsworn
Three thousand times within this three years' space;
For every man with his affects is born,
Not by might master'd but by special grace:
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
So to the laws at large I write my name:
And he that breaks them in the least degree
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
Suggestions are to other as to me;
But I believe, although I seem so loath,
I am the last that will last keep his oath.
But is there no quick recreation granted?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
With a refined traveller of Spain;
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
One whom the music of his own vain tongue
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
A man of complements, whom right and wrong
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
For interim to our studies shall relate
In high-born words the worth of many a knight
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Armado is a most illustrious wight,
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
And so to study, three years is but short.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD</stagedir><speech><persona>DULL</persona><text>Which is the duke's own person?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>This, fellow: what wouldst?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DULL</persona><text>I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
in flesh and blood.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>This is he.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DULL</persona><text>Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
abroad: this letter will tell you more.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>A letter from the magnificent Armado.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>To hear? or forbear laughing?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
forbear both.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
climb in the merriness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>In what manner?
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
her upon the form, and taken following her into the
park; which, put together, is in manner and form
following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
in some form.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>For the following, sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
the right!
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Will you hear this letter with attention?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>As we would hear an oracle.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
and body's fostering patron.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Not a word of Costard yet.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  'So it is,'--
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
telling true, but so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Peace!
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>No words!
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  'that shallow vassal,'--
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Still me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>O, me!
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
wherewith,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>With a wench.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
estimation.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>DULL</persona><text>'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
and heart-burning heat of duty.
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
that ever I heard.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
you to this?
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Sir, I confess the wench.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Did you hear the proclamation?
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
the marking of it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
with a wench.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>This maid will serve my turn, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
a week with bran and water.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
And go we, lords, to put in practise that
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN</stagedir><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
Sirrah, come on.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
till then, sit thee down, sorrow!

grows melancholy?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
tender juvenal?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Why tough senior? why tough senior?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may
nominate tender.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
old time, which we may name tough.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Pretty and apt.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
I apt, and my saying pretty?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Thou pretty, because little.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>And therefore apt, because quick.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Speak you this in my praise, master?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>In thy condign praise.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>I will praise an eel with the same praise.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>What, that an eel is ingenious?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>That an eel is quick.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>I am answered, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>I love not to be crossed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>I have promised to study three years with the duke.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>You may do it in an hour, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Impossible.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>How many is one thrice told?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
complete man.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
deuce-ace amounts to.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>It doth amount to one more than two.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Which the base vulgar do call three.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>True.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
study three years in two words, the dancing horse
will tell you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>A most fine figure!
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>To prove you a cipher.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
have been in love?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Hercules, master.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
repute and carriage.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
like a porter: and he was in love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
love, my dear Moth?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>A woman, master.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Of what complexion?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Tell me precisely of what complexion.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Of the sea-water green, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Is that one of the four complexions?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>My love is most immaculate white and red.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
such colours.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Define, define, well-educated infant.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
</text></speech><speech><persona>DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO</persona><text>Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
pathetical!
</text></speech><speech><persona>MOTH</persona><text>If she be made of white and red,
Her faults will ne'er be known,
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
And fears by pale white shown:
Then if she fear, or be to blame,
By this you shall not know,
For still her cheeks possess the same
Which native she doth owe.
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of

how can that be true love which is falsely

Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.

Consider who the king your father sends,
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
To parley with the sole inheritor
Of all perfections that a man may owe,
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
As Nature was in making graces dear
When she did starve the general world beside
And prodigally gave them all to you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
Than you much willing to be counted wise
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
Till painful study shall outwear three years,
No woman may approach his silent court:
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
Before we enter his forbidden gates,
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
Bold of your worthiness, we single you
As our best-moving fair solicitor.
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
Importunes personal conference with his grace:
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Proud of employment, willingly I go.

</text></speech><speech><persona>MARIA</persona><text>I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
It should none spare that come within his power.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?

Who are the rest?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
And much too little of that good I saw
Is my report to his great worthiness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Another of these students at that time
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
Within the limit of becoming mirth,
I never spent an hour's talk withal:
His eye begets occasion for his wit;
For every object that the one doth catch
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
Delivers in such apt and gracious words
That aged ears play truant at his tales
And younger hearings are quite ravished;
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
Being but the one half of an entire sum

But say that he or we, as neither have,
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
Although not valued to the money's worth.
If then the king your father will restore
But that one half which is unsatisfied,
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
For here he doth demand to have repaid
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
To have his title live in Aquitaine;
Which we much rather had depart withal
And have the money by our father lent
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
And go well satisfied to France again.

On a day--alack the day!--
Love, whose month is ever May,
Spied a blossom passing fair
Playing in the wanton air:
Through the velvet leaves the wind,
All unseen, can passage find;
That the lover, sick to death,
Wish himself the heaven's breath.
Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
Air, would I might triumph so!
But, alack, my hand is sworn
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
Do not call it sin in me,
That I am forsworn for thee;
Thou for whom Jove would swear
Juno but an Ethiope were;
And deny himself for Jove,
Turning mortal for thy love.
This will I send, and something else more plain,
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
For none offend where all alike do dote.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>  Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>  Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
You chide at him, offending twice as much;
You do not love Maria; Longaville
Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
I have been closely shrouded in this bush
And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
What will Biron say when that he shall hear
Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
For all the wealth that ever I did see,
I would not have him know so much by me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
These worms for loving, that art most in love?
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
There is no certain princess that appears;
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
But I a beam do find in each of three.
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
To see a king transformed to a gnat!
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
And where my liege's? all about the breast:
A caudle, ho!
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Too bitter is thy jest.
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
To break the vow I am engaged in;
I am betray'd, by keeping company
With men like men of inconstancy.
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
A leg, a limb?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Soft! whither away so fast?

</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
My red dominical, my golden letter:
O, that your face were not so full of O's!
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Madam, this glove.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Did he not send you twain?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Yes, madam, and moreover
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
A huge translation of hypocrisy,
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARIA</persona><text>This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
The letter is too long by half a mile.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
The chain were longer and the letter short?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARIA</persona><text>Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
O that I knew he were but in by the week!
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
And wait the season and observe the times
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
And shape his service wholly to my hests
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
That he should be my fool and I his fate.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>The blood of youth burns not with such excess
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARIA</persona><text>Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
Since all the power thereof it doth apply
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Enter BOYET</stagedir><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Thy news Boyet?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Prepare, madam, prepare!
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Under the cool shade of a sycamore
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
Toward that shade I might behold addrest
The king and his companions: warily
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
And overheard what you shall overhear,
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
Action and accent did they teach him there;
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
And ever and anon they made a doubt
Presence majestical would put him out,
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
A better speech was never spoke before;
Another, with his finger and his thumb,
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>But what, but what, come they to visit us?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
And every one his love-feat will advance
Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
By favours several which they did bestow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
And not a man of them shall have the grace,
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
And then the king will court thee for his dear;
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
And change your favours too; so shall your loves
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>But in this changing what is your intent?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
They do it but in mocking merriment;
And mock for mock is only my intent.
Their several counsels they unbosom shall
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
Upon the next occasion that we meet,
With visages displayed, to talk and greet.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>But shall we dance, if they desire to't?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
And quite divorce his memory from his part.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.

</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>What would they, say they?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Say to her, we have measured many miles
To tread a measure with her on this grass.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>They say, that they have measured many a mile
To tread a measure with you on this grass.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>It is not so. Ask them how many inches
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
The measure then of one is easily told.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>If to come hither you have measured miles,
And many miles, the princess bids you tell
How many inches doth fill up one mile.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>She hears herself.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>How many weary steps,
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>We number nothing that we spend for you:
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
That we may do it still without accompt.
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
That we, like savages, may worship it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Our ears vouchsafe it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>But your legs should do it.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Why take we hands, then?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Only to part friends:
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>More measure of this measure; be not nice.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>We can afford no more at such a price.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Your absence only.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>That can never be.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
Twice to your visor, and half once to you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>In private, then.

There's half-a-dozen sweets.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Seventh sweet, adieu:
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>One word in secret.

</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>Fair lady,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARIA</persona><text>Say you so? Fair lord,--
Take that for your fair lady.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>Please it you,
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>You have a double tongue within your mask,
And would afford my speechless vizard half.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>A calf, fair lady!
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>No, a fair lord calf.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>Let's part the word.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>No, I'll not be your half
Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>One word in private with you, ere I die.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
As is the razor's edge invisible,
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
Above the sense of sense; so sensible
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>O, they were all in lamentable cases!
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARIA</persona><text>Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
And trow you what he called me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Qualm, perhaps.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Yes, in good faith.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Go, sickness as thou art!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>And Longaville was for my service born.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARIA</persona><text>Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
Immediately they will again be here
In their own shapes; for it can never be
They will digest this harsh indignity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Will they return?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>They will, they will, God knows,
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
If they return in their own shapes to woo?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
Let us complain to them what fools were here,
Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
And wonder what they were and to what end
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
Should be presented at our tent to us.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.

</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Construe my speeches better, if you may.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>We came to visit you, and purpose now
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
As the unsullied lily, I protest,
A world of torments though I should endure,
I would not yield to be your house's guest;
So much I hate a breaking cause to be
Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>O, you have lived in desolation here,
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
A mess of Russians left us but of late.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>How, madam! Russians!
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Ay, in truth, my lord;
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
My lady, to the manner of the days,
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
We four indeed confronted were with four
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
They did not bless us with one happy word.
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
By light we lose light: your capacity
Is of that nature that to your huge store
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>I am a fool, and full of poverty.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>But that you take what doth to you belong,
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>All the fool mine?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>I cannot give you less.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
Can any face of brass hold longer out?
Here stand I lady, dart thy skill at me;
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
And I will wish thee never more to dance,
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
I do forswear them; and I here protest,
By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Sans sans, I pray you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Yet I have a trick
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
These lords are visited; you are not free,
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>It is not so; for how can this be true,
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
Some fair excuse.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>The fairest is confession.
Were not you here but even now disguised?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Madam, I was.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>And were you well advised?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>I was, fair madam.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>When you then were here,
What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>That more than all the world I did respect her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Upon mine honour, no.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Peace, peace! forbear:
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
As precious eyesight, and did value me
Above this world; adding thereto moreover
That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
Most honourably doth unhold his word.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
I never swore this lady such an oath.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>My faith and this the princess I did give:
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Neither of either; I remit both twain.
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
The ladies did change favours: and then we,
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
We are again forsworn, in will and error.
Much upon this it is: and might not you
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
Wounds like a leaden sword.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BOYET</persona><text>Full merrily
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>O Lord, sir, they would know
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>What, are there but three?
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>No, sir; but it is vara fine,
For every one pursents three.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>And three times thrice is nine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
what we know:
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Is not nine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
by reckoning, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>How much is it?
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Art thou one of the Worthies?
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Go, bid them prepare.
</text></speech><speech><persona>COSTARD</persona><text>We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
some care.

There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an

</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
The liberal opposition of our spirits,
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
In the converse of breath: your gentleness
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>The extreme parts of time extremely forms
All causes to the purpose of his speed,
And often at his very loose decides
That which long process could not arbitrate:
And though the mourning brow of progeny
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
The holy suit which fain it would convince,
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>I understand you not: my griefs are double.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
And by these badges understand the king.
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
Even to the opposed end of our intents:
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
As love is full of unbefitting strains,
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
To every varied object in his glance:
Which parti-coated presence of loose love
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
Our love being yours, the error that love makes
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
By being once false for ever to be true
To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>We have received your letters full of love;
Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
And, in our maiden council, rated them
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
As bombast and as lining to the time:
But more devout than this in our respects
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
In their own fashion, like a merriment.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>So did our looks.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>We did not quote them so.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
Grant us your loves.
</text></speech><speech><persona>PRINCESS</persona><text>A time, methinks, too short
To make a world-without-end bargain in.
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
If for my love, as there is no such cause,
You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
There stay until the twelve celestial signs
Have brought about the annual reckoning.
If this austere insociable life
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
But that it bear this trial and last love;
Then, at the expiration of the year,
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
I will be thine; and till that instant shut
My woeful self up in a mourning house,
Raining the tears of lamentation
For the remembrance of my father's death.
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
Neither entitled in the other's heart.
</text></speech><speech><persona>FERDINAND</persona><text>If this, or more than this, I would deny,
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>[And what to me, my love? and what to me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd,
You are attaint with faults and perjury:
Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
But seek the weary beds of people sick.]
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>A beard, fair health, and honesty;
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
Come when the king doth to my lady come;
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUMAIN</persona><text>I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
</text></speech><speech><persona>KATHARINE</persona><text>Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>What says Maria?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARIA</persona><text>At the twelvemonth's end
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LONGAVILLE</persona><text>I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARIA</persona><text>The liker you; few taller are so young.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
What humble suit attends thy answer there:
Impose some service on me for thy love.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
Which you on all estates will execute
That lie within the mercy of your wit.
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
And therewithal to win me, if you please,
Without the which I am not to be won,
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
Visit the speechless sick and still converse
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BIRON</persona><text>To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
It cannot be; it is impossible:
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ROSALINE</persona><text>Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
And I will have you and that fault withal;
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
And I shall find you empty of that fault,
Right joyful of your reformation.

This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
cuckoo. Ver, begin.
When daisies pied and violets blue
And lady-smocks all silver-white
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,  Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
And maidens bleach their summer smocks
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,  Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!
When icicles hang by the wall
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
And Tom bears logs into the hall
And milk comes frozen home in pail,
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
When all aloud the wind doth blow
And coughing drowns the parson's saw
And birds sit brooding in the snow
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,  Tu-whit;
Tu-who, a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
