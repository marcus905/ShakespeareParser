O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
That o'er the files and musters of the war
Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gipsy's lust.
Look, where they come:
Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
The triple pillar of the world transform'd
Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.

Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>How, my love!
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Perchance! nay, and most like:
You must not stay here longer, your dismission
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
On pain of punishment, the world to weet
We stand up peerless.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Excellent falsehood!
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
Will be himself.

Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:

To weep; whose every passion fully strives
To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!

To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.

to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.

</text></speech><speech><persona>CHARMIAN</persona><text>O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Soothsayer</persona><text>You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune

tell her but a worky-day fortune.

</text></speech><speech><persona>CHARMIAN</persona><text>Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
</text></speech><speech><persona>IRAS</persona><text>Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a

decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

But soon that war had end, and the time's state
Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;
Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,
Upon the first encounter, drave them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Well, what worst?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Messenger</persona><text>The nature of bad news infects the teller.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
I hear him as he flatter'd.

Extended Asia from Euphrates;

</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
With such full licence as both truth and malice
Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
By revolution lowering, does become
The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
I must from this enchanting queen break off:
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</stagedir><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>What's your pleasure, sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>I must with haste from hence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>Why, then, we kill all our women:
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>I must be gone.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>She is cunning past man's thought.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exit ALEXAS</stagedir><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
shower of rain as well as Jove.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Would I had never seen her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
of work; which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Fulvia is dead.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>Sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Fulvia is dead.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>Fulvia!
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Dead.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
out, there are members to make new. If there were
no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
that should water this sorrow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>The business she hath broached in the state
Cannot endure my absence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>And the business you have broached here cannot be
without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
wholly depends on your abode.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>No more light answers. Let our officers
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
The cause of our expedience to the queen,
And get her leave to part. For not alone
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
Of many our contriving friends in Rome
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
Pompey the Great and all his dignities
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
To such whose place is under us, requires
Our quick remove from hence.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>I shall do't.

</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Now, my dearest queen,--

</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>What's the matter?
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
What says the married woman? You may go:
Would she had never given you leave to come!
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
I have no power upon you; hers you are.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>The gods best know,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>O, never was there queen
So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
I saw the treasons planted.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Cleopatra,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Why should I think you can be mine and true,
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
Which break themselves in swearing!
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Most sweet queen,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
Then was the time for words: no going then;
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,
But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
Art turn'd the greatest liar.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>How now, lady!
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
There were a heart in Egypt.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Hear me, queen:
The strong necessity of time commands
Our services awhile; but my full heart
Remains in use with you. Our Italy
Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
Equality of two domestic powers
Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,
Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
By any desperate change: my more particular,
And that which most with you should safe my going,
Is Fulvia's death.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>She's dead, my queen:
Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:
See when and where she died.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>O most false love!
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
As you shall give the advice. By the fire
That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war
As thou affect'st.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,
So Antony loves.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>My precious queen, forbear;
And give true evidence to his love, which stands
An honourable trial.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>So Fulvia told me.
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
Of excellent dissembling; and let it look
Life perfect honour.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>You'll heat my blood: no more.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Now, by my sword,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>And target. Still he mends;
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
How this Herculean Roman does become
The carriage of his chafe.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>I'll leave you, lady.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Courteous lord, one word.
Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
That you know well: something it is I would,
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
And I am all forgotten.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>But that your royalty
Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
For idleness itself.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>'Tis sweating labour
To bear such idleness so near the heart
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
Since my becomings kill me, when they do not
Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
Be strew'd before your feet!
</text></speech><speech><persona>MARK ANTONY</persona><text>Let us go. Come;

and their Train</stagedir><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
Our great competitor: from Alexandria
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like
Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
A man who is the abstract of all faults
That all men follow.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LEPIDUS</persona><text>I must not think there are
Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,
Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
Than what he chooses.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;
To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
becomes him,--
As his composure must be rare indeed
Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony
No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
Call on him for't: but to confound such time,
That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid
As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
And so rebel to judgment.

</text></speech><speech><persona>Messenger</persona><text>Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;
And it appears he is beloved of those
That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
The discontents repair, and men's reports
Give him much wrong'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>I should have known no less.
It hath been taught us from the primal state,
That he which is was wish'd until he were;
And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
To rot itself with motion.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Messenger</persona><text>Caesar, I bring thee word,
Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
They make in Italy; the borders maritime
Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
Than could his war resisted.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>Antony,
Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
Though daintily brought up, with patience more
Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
Which some did die to look on: and all this--
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
So much as lank'd not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>LEPIDUS</persona><text>'Tis pity of him.

Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
Thrives in our idleness.

The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
For so he calls me: now I feed myself
With most delicious poison. Think on me,
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
When thou wast here above the ground, I was
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;

And have my learning from some true reports,
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
Discredit my authority with yours;
And make the wars alike against my stomach,
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
As matter whole you have not to make it with,

Very necessity of this thought, that I,
Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,

The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle
You may pace easy, but not such a wife.

Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
It beggar'd all description: she did lie
In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
And what they undid did.

</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
And made their bends adornings: at the helm
A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
That yarely frame the office. From the barge
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
Her people out upon her; and Antony,
Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,
Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
And made a gap in nature.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AGRIPPA</persona><text>Rare Egyptian!
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
Invited her to supper: she replied,
It should be better he became her guest;
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
And for his ordinary pays his heart
For what his eyes eat only.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AGRIPPA</persona><text>Royal wench!
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>I saw her once
Hop forty paces through the public street;
And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
That she did make defect perfection,
And, breathless, power breathe forth.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MECAENAS</persona><text>Now Antony must leave her utterly.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</persona><text>Never; he will not:
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
Her infinite variety: other women cloy
The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
Bless her when she is riggish.
</text></speech><speech><persona>MECAENAS</persona><text>If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle

His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:

sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
I said before, that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
he married but his occasion here.

He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
That grew the more by reaping: his delights
Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
The element they lived in: in his livery
Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were

O rarely base!
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>Good queen, let us entreat you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
Doing the honour of thy lordliness
To one so meek, that mine own servant should
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
That I some lady trifles have reserved,
Immoment toys, things of such dignity
As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
Some nobler token I have kept apart
For Livia and Octavia, to induce
Their mediation; must I be unfolded
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
Beneath the fall I have.
Prithee, go hence;
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>Forbear, Seleucus.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exit SELEUCUS</stagedir><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
For things that others do; and, when we fall,
We answer others' merits in our name,
Are therefore to be pitied.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>Cleopatra,
Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
For we intend so to dispose you as
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
Our care and pity is so much upon you,
That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>My master, and my lord!
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>Not so. Adieu.

And we are for the dark.

Go put it to the haste.

</text></speech><speech><persona>DOLABELLA</persona><text>Caesar, thy thoughts

So sought'st to hinder.

That will not be denied your highness presence:
He brings you figs.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Let him come in.
What poor an instrument
May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
Of woman in me: now from head to foot
I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
No planet is of mine.

</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Avoid, and leave him.
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
That kills and pains not?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party
that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
never recover.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of
them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
but something given to lie; as a woman should not
do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
worm's an odd worm.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Get thee hence; farewell.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>I wish you all joy of the worm.

do his kind.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Ay, ay; farewell.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
goodness in worm.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
not worth the feeding.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Will it eat me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>You must not think I am so simple but I know the
devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
that they make, the devils mar five.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>Well, get thee gone; farewell.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Clown</persona><text>Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.

Immortal longings in me: now no more
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
Antony call; I see him rouse himself
To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
Now to that name my courage prove my title!
I am fire and air; my other elements
I give to baser life. So; have you done?
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
If thou and nature can so gently part,
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
It is not worth leave-taking.
</text></speech><speech><persona>CHARMIAN</persona><text>Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
The gods themselves do weep!
</text></speech><speech><persona>CLEOPATRA</persona><text>This proves me base:
If she first meet the curled Antony,
He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
mortal wretch,
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
Unpolicied!

O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.

</text></speech><speech><persona>CHARMIAN</persona><text>It is well done, and fitting for a princess
Descended of so many royal kings.
Ah, soldier!

That you did fear is done.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>Bravest at the last,
She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
I do not see them bleed.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOLABELLA</persona><text>Who was last with them?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Guard</persona><text>A simple countryman, that brought her figs:
This was his basket.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>Poison'd, then.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Guard</persona><text>O Caesar,
This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:
I found her trimming up the diadem
On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
And on the sudden dropp'd.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>O noble weakness!
If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear
By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,
As she would catch another Antony
In her strong toil of grace.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DOLABELLA</persona><text>Here, on her breast,
There is a vent of blood and something blown:
The like is on her arm.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Guard</persona><text>This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
Upon the caves of Nile.
</text></speech><speech><persona>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</persona><text>Most probable
That so she died; for her physician tells me
She hath pursued conclusions infinite
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
And bear her women from the monument:
She shall be buried by her Antony:
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
A pair so famous. High events as these
Strike those that make them; and their story is
No less in pity than his glory which
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
In solemn show attend this funeral;
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
High order in this great solemnity.
