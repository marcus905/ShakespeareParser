And by the doom of death end woes and all.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
I am not partial to infringe our laws:
The enmity and discord which of late
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
For, since the mortal and intestine jars
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
It hath in solemn synods been decreed
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
If any born at Ephesus be seen
At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
Again: if any Syracusian born
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
Unless a thousand marks be levied,
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
Why thou departed'st from thy native home
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>A heavier task could not have been imposed
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
By prosperous voyages I often made
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
And the great care of goods at random left
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
From whom my absence was not six months old
Before herself, almost at fainting under
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
Had made provision for her following me
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
There had she not been long, but she became
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
A meaner woman was delivered
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
Made daily motions for our home return:
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
We came aboard.
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
Before the always wind-obeying deep
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
But longer did we not retain much hope;
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
And this it was, for other means was none:
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
To him one of the other twins was bound,
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
And by the benefit of his wished light,
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
Two ships from far making amain to us,
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
Gather the sequel by that went before.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>O, had the gods done so, I had not now
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
Which being violently borne upon,
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
Fortune had left to both of us alike
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
Was carried with more speed before the wind;
And in our sight they three were taken up
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
At length, another ship had seized on us;
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
Do me the favour to dilate at full
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
At eighteen years became inquisitive
After his brother: and importuned me
That his attendant--so his case was like,
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
Might bear him company in the quest of him:
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
Or that or any place that harbours men.
But here must end the story of my life;
And happy were I in my timely death,
Could all my travels warrant me they live.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
But, though thou art adjudged to the death
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
But to our honour's great disparagement,
Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
To seek thy life by beneficial help:
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Gaoler</persona><text>I will, my lord.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here;
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the town,
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
There is your money that I had to keep.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>Many a man would take you at your word,
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
</text></speech></speeches><speeches><stagedir>Exit</stagedir><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town,
And then go to my inn and dine with me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Merchant</persona><text>I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
And afterward consort you till bed-time:
My present business calls me from you now.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.
</text></speech><speech><persona>First Merchant</persona><text>Sir, I commend you to your own content.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
Here comes the almanac of my true date.
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to-day.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>I am not in a sportive humour now:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
My mistress and her sister stays for you.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again,
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>Upon my life, by some device or other
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage,
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
And many such-like liberties of sin:
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
I greatly fear my money is not safe.

Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
Are masters to their females, and their lords:
Then let your will attend on their accords.

We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,

So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCIANA</persona><text>Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his

When I desired him to come home to dinner,
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!

My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet,
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
But here's a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>I think thou art an ass.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Marry, so it doth appear

I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.

A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.
</text></speech><speech><persona>BALTHAZAR</persona><text>Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

</text></speech><speech><persona>BALTHAZAR</persona><text>Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
Herein you war against your reputation
And draw within the compass of suspect
The unviolated honour of your wife.
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
And about evening come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
For slander lives upon succession,
For ever housed where it gets possession.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
I know a wench of excellent discourse,
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
To her will we to dinner.
Get you home
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANGELO</persona><text>I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.

A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
And let her read it in thy looks at board:
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
Being compact of credit, that you love us;
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
We in your motion turn and you may move us.
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:

When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not

Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
To make it wander in an unknown field?
Are you a god? would you create me new?
Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
But if that I am I, then well I know
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
Far more, far more to you do I decline.
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
And in that glorious supposition think
He gains by death that hath such means to die:
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

Besides this present instance of his rage,
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
On purpose shut the doors against his way.
My way is now to hie home to his house,
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
He rush'd into my house and took perforce
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
For forty ducats is too much to lose.

</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
While she with harlots feasted in my house.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADRIANA</persona><text>No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
As this is false he burdens me withal!
</text></speech><speech><persona>LUCIANA</persona><text>Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
But she tells to your highness simple truth!
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANGELO</persona><text>O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
In this the madman justly chargeth them.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>My liege, I am advised what I say,
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
Could witness it, for he was with me then;
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
I went to seek him: in the street I met him
And in his company that gentleman.
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
That I this day of him received the chain,
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
He did arrest me with an officer.
I did obey, and sent my peasant home
For certain ducats: he with none return'd
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
To go in person with me to my house.
By the way we met
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
Of vile confederates. Along with them
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
There left me and my man, both bound together;
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
To give me ample satisfaction
For these deep shames and great indignities.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANGELO</persona><text>My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>But had he such a chain of thee or no?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANGELO</persona><text>He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
These people saw the chain about his neck.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Second Merchant</persona><text>Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
Heard you confess you had the chain of him
After you first forswore it on the mart:
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
And then you fled into this abbey here,
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>I never came within these abbey-walls,
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
And this is false you burden me withal.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
If here you housed him, here he would have been;
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
</text></speech><speech><persona>Courtezan</persona><text>He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
</text></speech><speech><persona>Courtezan</persona><text>As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
I think you are all mated or stark mad.

And is not that your bondman, Dromio?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>I am sure you both of you remember me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
For lately we were bound, as you are now
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>Why look you strange on me? you know me well.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
And careful hours with time's deformed hand
Have written strange defeatures in my face:
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Neither.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>Dromio, nor thou?
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>No, trust me, sir, nor I.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>I am sure thou dost.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
In seven short years, that here my only son
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
Yet hath my night of life some memory,
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>I never saw my father in my life.
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>The duke and all that know me in the city
Can witness with me that it is not so
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
Have I been patron to Antipholus,
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:

Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
And speak unto the same AEmilia!
</text></speech><speech><persona>AEGEON</persona><text>If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:

</text></speech><speech><persona>AEMELIA</persona><text>By men of Epidamnum he and I
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
By force took Dromio and my son from them
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
What then became of them I cannot tell
I to this fortune that you see me in.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>Why, here begins his morning story right;
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
These are the parents to these children,
Which accidentally are met together.
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>And I with him.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADRIANA</persona><text>Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>I, gentle mistress.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADRIANA</persona><text>And are not you my husband?
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>No; I say nay to that.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>And so do I; yet did she call me so:
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
Did call me brother.
What I told you then,
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
If this be not a dream I see and hear.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANGELO</persona><text>That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANGELO</persona><text>I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ADRIANA</persona><text>I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</persona><text>No, none by me.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</persona><text>This purse of ducats I received from you,
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
I see we still did meet each other's man,
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
And thereupon these errors are arose.
</text></speech><speech><persona>ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</persona><text>These ducats pawn I for my father here.
</text></speech><speech><persona>DUKE SOLINUS</persona><text>It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
